if hitler had any settled aims, attacking russia was one of them. in 1924 in mein kampf hitler had urged territorial exp and insisted that 'when we speak of new lands to give living space to the german ppl in the struggle for existence we must first thing of russian and her border states'.

  in june 2 1940 hitler opined that the uk would soon be ready for a 'reasonable peace' and then 'at last he would have a free hand' for his 'great and true task: the conflict with bolshevism'.

  idea being that sooner they knocked out russia, being unable to overcome britain, the sooner they could sue for peace on their terms. defeating england might take up to two years, but without russia they'd be effectively isolated on the continent and more amenable.
  with attack in 1940 being impossible they settled for may 1941.

  The unexpected ability of britain to repel german attacks forced hitler to choose between sustained cooperation with the ussr, which conveniently furnished them with the minerals and food which they needed to terribly, and was obviously difficult to 'destroy'.

they never even figured out what to do after victory with land beyond the urals. 

by 1940 tho evidence accumulated that roosevelt had decided that US resources should be used to defend british indep. In 1941 US strenght would be negligible, 1942 significant and thereafter formidabke. Without being certain of defeating Britain by 1941, this promised a bitter struggle against the anglo saxons to endure beyond 1942; in the meanwhile the ussr could only grow stronger, leaving germany to be increasingly vulnerable to russian threats.
If they could remove russia in 1941, germany would control all the resources in continental europe and be able to face the anglo americn coalition with confidence.

furthermore in 1941 the uk would be weakened by subs and surface ships while JP could act with impunity to threaten american interests. On the assumption that it could be done in a single campaign, this was a powerful argument.

catastrophic combat losses the red army suffered during this period consumed a large proportion of those who were serving in june 1941

Red army numbered 5.5 million men on 22 june 1941, about 2.7 of which were serving in field forces stationed in the western military districts. at that time soviet mobil pool contained about 12 million men, which included many fuly or partially trained reservists. this mobil capability prod the forces nec to replace those soldiers lost in 41 42 amd even increased the army's overall strength

consequently despite losing 4,473,820 men in 1941 and another 7,369,278 men in 1942 the red army's field strength increased to 6,101,000 ib 2 feb 1942, 6,724,00 on 9 jul 1943 and 6,165,000 on 31 dec 1943.

these figures capture scole and scale of the red army's transformation in terms of size and overal config. in a less tangible sense they also ber striking witness to the army's ability to endure combat of unprecendented ferocity and proportion and yet still emerge intact. these cold & impersonal numbers also provide clear evidence of the red army's soldiers seemingly limitless capability for surviving amid excruciating suffering. 

[hatred of the enemy born of nationalism or ideological fervour together wil healthy doses of harsh discipline and official intimidation to say nothing of trad russ fatalism combined to sustain the red army in the field and to propel it intact through nearly ceaseless conflict]

these staggering figures however do not adequately reflect the scope of the internal trnsf within the red army, which enabled it to compete with and ultimately defeat the vaunted german Wehrmacht. as large and impose as the red army's force struct was on paper in 1941, war proved it to be a cumbersome and inept military force ill equipped to contest the more tried and tested Wehrmacht. Size alone could not compensate for shortsighted strategic leadership, clumsy mobil, inflexible command and control at the op and tactical levels, and ill trained and ill equipped soldiers in the field.
  Consequently, the wehrmacht savaged the red army during the first six months of the war, wrecking both its prewar concepts for waging war and its mil forces. faced with seemingly limitless cascading calamities, the red army recoiled, trditong territory and solderis' lives for time.

in the last analysis, a combination of facotrs allowed the ussr and the rarmy to survive the war.
  1. the german army attempted to wage warfare in the immense expanse of eurasia employing strategic and operational techniques better suited to the more limited confines of west and cent europe. it was woefully ill prepared to operate in and cope with the unique terrain and climatic conditions in the ussr much less its vast territorial expanse
  2. excessive german ambition coupled with congenital overconfidence and a nearly constant inability on the part of the Armed Forces (OKW) and the Army High Commands (OKH) to define precise and achievable strategic objectives confounded the abilities of the even most talented of german field commanders. Time and again the Wehrmacht's reach exceeded its grasp.
  3. tho the ussr's mobil sys was slow and cumbersome, once set in motion it was inexorable, prod wave after wave of new armies which tho often scarcely worthy of the name repeatedly refilled the rarmy's depleted order of battle at times when the germans were convinced the sovs were down to their last battalians. quantity did matter both materially and psych. however weak the new armies were their existence and surprise appearance disconcerted german commanders
  4. (most important) the ability of ussr's political and mil leadership to adjust to a wide variety of nasty realities. despite its monumental initial failings, dire circumstances themselves impilled the sov strategic leadership principally stalin and the stavka (HQ of the Supreme High Command) to recognise that whole sale changes were required in the way in which it planned for and waged war.

  For the duration of what the ussr calls the great patriotic war, the sov armed forces

more ppl fought and died there than on all the other fronts of the war around the globe put together, due to three factors:
  massive size of the forces emgaged
  the nature of the fighting that made it unlikely that the to sides would return to peaceful relations
  the ability of germany's enemies to stick together and thereby insure germany's eventual defeat

the attack launched in operation br was a total surprise.
last minute aler to units on the front but orders were to hold fire in case it was a provocation

luftwafte at 60% of its strength using over 2700 destroyed a large portion of the soviet air force on the ground and shot down most of the soviet air force
the resulting total german control of the air did not last long but it was in effect in the early months of fighting and greatly facilitated the advance of germany's ground forces.

pg265
striking element in these rapid advances was not the large areas overrun so much as the huge soviet forces enveloped and destroyed by rapid armoured thrusts followed by an experienced and effectively fighting infantry

the germans very much wanted to destroy as much of the RA as close to the border as possible hoping that such terrific initial blows would topple the whole soviet structure. the one thing they did not want as a long campaign with a need to drive russians back slowly and frontrally for hundreds even thousands of mles.

these dramatic victories gave the german leadership at the very top the impression that they had accomplished their goals, to destroy soviet mil power in one hard blow.

pg 266
recognizing but not understanding the implications of the determined fight most RA men put up whether surrounded or being driven back the germans believed they had won the critical battle.

this impression of victory was heightened by the events of the first two weeks of july. in further great encirclement battles AGCenter now increased to five armies, swept into central russia

whole german campaign predicated on the assumption that it would be a short campaign. no replacements were available or planned for either personnel or equipment after the first weeks, and no one was worried about this situation. one of the astonishing features of the detailed situation maps kept by the germans is the absence of substantial numbers of formations in reserve, a characteristic of tese maps that would true until the last days of the campaign in the east. the air force exected to be back fighting the british after two months, most anti aircraft guns were at home or in the west. During July hitler and many german leaders believed that the gamble had paid off.

hitler expected new german border to be at the urals.

pg267
the bulk of the urban pop in Euro russia was to be starved to death, as would the captured RA soldiers, a subject on which hitler, his econ expert and the mil were all in agreement.

no rights to be allowed any remaining population last of all possibility of bearing arms. 

in those same days of late jul hitler also appears to have given instructions most likely verbally for the extension of the program for killing the jews in occupied soviet territories and among the pows to all the jews of german controlled europe. by this point the mass murder, which started in the first days of the invasion was by this time claiming thousands of lives daily. there had been lil objection and now was the time to expand proj.

pg268
in spite of the enormous losses in men and equipment suffered by the russians there was clearly both a continuing front and a steady if not yet massive stream of new formations and replacements. furthermore the men of the RA were fighting hard; there were local counter attacks and there were signs of revival from the red air force which the germans had misassessed both as to its frontline strength and replacement capabilities.

the soviet system was clearly holding together, and as word spread of thekilling of all captured political officers of the red army of the slaughter of numerous other prisoners of war and the horrendous mistreatment of the rest, the fate which awaited those who fell under german control began to become increasingly obvious to soviet citizens on both sides of the front.

pg269
earlist sisgns of an awakening can be detected in 2nd half of july by 1st week of august it was beginning to be recognized that teh caucasus and murmansk would prolly not be reached in 1941 and that the campaign could be expected to continue into the following year.

german units had to be refurbished and during the ensuing pause of late july and aug decisions ahd to be made as to the direction of the next offensives. the very fact that such decisions as to priorities for further major offensive ops were nec showed that the origi german plan to bring about the collapse of the ussr had failed.

if anyone still doubted this the heavy sov counter attacks on the central front removed them.

germans now had to decide whether to resume the offensive on the central front or in the south and north. the very fact that they could not repeat the earliler simultaneous offensives in all three sectors shows the weakening of german assault strenght or the lengthning of the front as they moved east and the obv. existence of soviet resistence.
