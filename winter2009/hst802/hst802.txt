the origins of the ww2

what happened? great war was supposed to be eoall war.

1919-1930s post ww1 era mgmt
early 1930s-1939 follow major downturn in 1929, things get rough, rise of national socialism.

The legacy of ww1 1919-1930
  nov11 1918 eoww1.
  Even though it was over, the war was still going on in central europe.
  Real problem in 1919 the disappearance of Austria Hungary, leaving behind a mass of small countries with conflicts over borders. Throughout 1920s war is waged over these borders.

  Paris peace conf
    major flaws:
      A congress of victors, a first in european history. previously, at the end of a war, all of the participants would gather and discuss the peace process. in 1815, napoleon lost finally and so in vienna peace conference france was invited. In Paris, Germany isn't invited until the end when it was time to sign the treaty, provoking a lot of resentment.
      All the major decisions were made by the council of Four (US, UK, FR, IT).
      Consequently, it looked like a Diktat, or 'imposed settlement'.

    Germany treated as the guilty party
      considered the sole cause, which allowed for
	- losing territories (Alsace-Lorraine, Polish corridor isolating east prussia). 10% of German territory, population, lost.
	- forced to disarm and demobolise its army down to 100,000 men. Eventually fuels resentment as .de is circled by powerful armies.
	- forced to pay war reparations, somehow.

      Western powers showed little sense of solidarity amongst themselves. 
	Disagreed on almost everything.
	Allied diplomacy greatly underestimated the problem of enforcement. Initially starting out to reform IR and present some form of collective security, except UK and FR had no intention to reform ways and removed all teeth from the League of Nations.
	UK worried eowar, now that .de is srsly weakened, that FR would become too powerful. UK FP based on 'balance of power', where no single nation on eu continent should dominate whole of europe.
	Highly suspicious at US commitment to change IR. Proven right as eventually US would not ratify treaty of versailles.
	Marshal Foch: "This is not peace; it is an Armistice for twenty years"

      Left with a series of countries who wouldn't mind repealing the treaty.

  The question of war reparations
    Article in treaty, .de "guilty of starting ww1", ergo must bear the consequences. At not time did .de want to pay these hefty reparations.
    Between the two wars, history of eu dominated by this issue.
    
    War reparations tied to another problem:
      - war debts; how did the FR and the UK manage to pay for their war effort? They borrowed heavily from the US. By eoww1, hugely in debt and war reparations appealing. 

    German inflation spikes and the economy is in shambles; UK & US are lenient but FR is having none of this and invade the Ruhr (the industrial heartland) in 1923. FR ultimately forced to leave.

  Resurgence of Germany
    mid 1920s, a new foreign minister Gustav Stresemann comes in.
      Taking advantage of UK/FR animosity, he plays them against each other. Seeking a compromise on issue of reparations, he convinces his debtors to go for international arbitration, calling in the US. Charles Dawes sits with UK and Fr and reach a compromise to pay until 1988. 
      Stresemann approaches US and says, if our economy is ruined we might actually have to undergo a revolution and become communist! That would be bad. Plz help us streghten our economy with some nice loans? US says sure!, as a stronger europe means more markets to exploit. New loans allowed them to repay reparations and bootstrap economy.
      Stresemann agrees to sign the Locarno pact with the French, recognising the border b/w FR and .de, finally stabilising relations.

  The EOVersailles treaty and the failure of collective security
    League of Nations
      war as last resort; 
      despite being started by Wilson, US never participates not wanting to get involved in other's affairs.
      only nations involved UK and FR, as IT, JP and DE leave in early 1930s
      League never possessed the means to enforce its own sanctions.

      - First challenge comes in 1931 as JP invades Manchuria.
	  JP reprimanded by League, and they leave.
      - Then, invasion of Ethiopia in 1935 by IT
	  One of the few indie African countries, Italy is all like why hullo thar and adds them to their colonies.
	  Emperor of Ethiopia travels to Geneva to plead his case and ask for help. UK and FR bicker over what to do, disagreeing, don't even apply sanction against Italy. Italy is just reprimanded, and they leave the League.

      Should League of Nations be an instrument of conciliation or a machine of security?

    The Great Depression and the Rise of Hitler to Power.
      1929 opened a world of pain, trashing .de and its US loans.
      1933 Hitler rose to power, one of first FP decisions pulls out of League of Nations.
	UK & FR, would the USSR be a counterweight to Hitler? Unwilling to compromise with the Bolsheviks, that fails.
      By 1920s, disarment talk fails as Hitler begins rearmament in 1930s.

    Remilitarization of the Rhineland
      Following Versailles, no .de troops were allowed in the Rhineland. Hitler quickly remilitarises the region. 
      FR & UK do nothing, allowing Hitler to grow in confidence.

    The Anschluss in 1938
      merger of germany and austria
	int'l reaction? Bad germans! Did nothing.
	Paralyzed by prospect of ww2.

  Why did Western Democracies not understand Hitler?
    FR & UK FP dominated by a double fear:
      Fear of war; srsly did not want to go to war again. FR lost so much in ww1 they developed conflict phobia, over 1.4 million soldiers. Ditto in UK, leading to a policy of appeasement.
      Fear of communism; Western democracies more worried about rise of USSR than Nazi Germany. Many ppl believed that .de would stand against threat of Commies; better the fascists than the commies sweeping through the rest of Europe.

  1938: the turning point
    German concept of 'peaceful aggression'. Hitler pretty pleased; basically, a combination of bluffing and threats. 
    Working beautifully since 1933, why stop? By 1938, Nazis had no intention at starting global war; Hitler's goal ultimately todestroy treaty of Versailles. 
    
    Next target was Czechoslovakia. 
      Why?
	Sudetenland populated by majority of Germans, nation created by Versailles. 
      Well armed and prepared to defend themselves, they built a powerful line of fortifications along the .de border. Also, the Czechs signed a formal .mil alliance with France. Germans are aware of this, so how are FR and UK going to react? All signs pointed to war.

      FR war phobic and more prepared to defend themselves. Initially prepared to intervene, but ultimately ready to forego its .mil alliances.

    Munich agreement in 1938
      UK & FR completely abandon Czechoslovakia, give it over to DE.
      Famous statement by Chamberlain, 'peace for our time', waving a paper signed by Hitler.
      Not seen very kindly by USSR.

      Ultimately, a recipe for disaster:
	FR & UK cross a new threshold in their appeasement, losing all credibility after abandoning their agreements, causing other countries to think twice before signing an agreement with UK & FR.
	FR & UK say, at the very least, we gained some time. We now know that Hitler is dangerous, we can now embark on rearmament. Problem was, Germans were also rearming very quickly. Germans were able to study French built line of fortifications in Czechoslovakia and learn its weakness. Czech army absorbed into DE army.
	USSR says, fuck those guys, decides to negotiate with Germans as well. 
	  In last days of Aug 1939 USSR DE sign non agression pact.
	
	Hitler's popularity explodes in Germany, doing whatever he pleases without consequences.
	Munich agreement led to war the following war, as Hitler becomes convinced that his peaceful aggression would work continuously and targets Poland.
	Problem was, after invading all of CZ, British and French stop believing they can avoid war permanently.

      Two days after DE invades Poland, FR & UK declare war.

# ah getting in late...

collective bonds to unite people;
hitler had mass rallies

use of propaganda to move opinion.

The vision of the 'new man'
  In .de - Creation of the new man who is going to be perfect, ostracizing the jews and idealizing 'the nordic ideal' blonde blue eyed man, racially pure.

  In USSR - 'classless society'. 

A charismatic leader
  vision of leader as a saviour. 
  Hitler when he gave a speech he would build up momentum in his speech, shouting by the end of it, mesmerizing his audience.
  Mussolini, similarly.

The one party state
  Create a new elite and new state ideology.
  Systematic censorship & propaganda allows the building of a consensus.
  Also builds a war philosophy.
    Basically, these totalitarian regimes have war at their essence, magnifying the perceived external threat in order to enhance internal cohesion, and promoting war as a means to purify society.
    Hitler said very early on that he was preparing for war.

  In art, 'nazi' promoting fatherland ideals vs 'degenerate' art.


The rise of communism in EEurope fuelled fascism.
  Although they had lots in common they hated each other.
  The failed communist revolution in HUngary led to a fascist regime.
  A general strike in Italy (Oct '22), dominated by It Commies, led to Mussolini's 'March On Rome'
  In Germany, the strenght of the Commies frightened the German conservatives and industrialists and led them to hand over power to Hitler.

Italy in the 1920s: The Cradle of Fascism

  'after all, it was [Mussolini] who shoed us that everything was possible'

Do remember, Hitler rose to power democratic means.

The Nazi Party
  Did poor in 1928 general elections.
  Yet in 1932 Nazi party had become the main political party in the land.
    Why?
      Economic downturn hit Germany particularly hard, being dependent on American loans which dried up immediately after the '29 crash. 
      Added to Versailles resentment, you have a perfect opportunity for hard liners to emerge.
      In 1935 the Nazi party flag became the German national flag in 1935.
  In 1932, #2 were the German commies, in GElections.
    Fearing the influence of Communism, German elites give the chancellorship to Hitler.

    One of the first actions the Nazis took was to burn down the Reichstag, the national parliament, blaming it on the Commies, basically ending the Commie Party in Germany.
      Hitler declares a state of emergency and assumes dictatorial powers, and from that point on Germany becomes a one-state party, and begin their plans for national cohesion.

  From '33-39, the Nazis gradually organize military parades, pick on the jews as the national scapegoat, agenda of spreading territory for breeding space.

  Hitler was ultimately convinced that FR & UK would not intervene.

Next week on monday, the initial victories of Germany.


@jan 19

the blitzkrieg (lightning war) from Poland to Russia 1939-1941
  military doctrine implemented by .de
  innovative use of tanks and aircraft, having appeared first in ww1. Initially they didn't do too well, as they were very slow. Post war improvement in technology allowed vast improvements in aircraft and tanks.
  
  Foundation of blitzkrieg
    Initially did not believe in future of the tank, but in ww1 were the first to introduce the idea of mobile warfare, as that war was characterized by static fronts.

    Elite "stormtrooper" infantry units in ww1. The idea behind them was speed and the element of surprise. If they could actually quickly surprise their enemies they could be successful at breaking the front and winning the war.
    Concentration - the idea that lots of tanks in one unit they become harder to defeat.

    Problem: speed & surprise is hard when you mostly have men on foot. 

    In 1930s General Guderian became one of the main bliz proponents, writing Achtung Panzer where he argues that a high concentration of fast moving tanks could break through enemy lines. 

    The Panzer divisions were meant to be a highly mobile miniature army, placing commanders close to the front, allowing them to be more flexible.
  
  The Invasion of Poland: the german plan
    Idea that the blitz was impl early on the war, but in fact was not initially welcomed by the high command or hitler, being highly skeptical.
    It was only at the last minute before the beginning of the invasion that it got adopted, becoming military doctrine only after the collapse of france.

    Sept 1 1939 .de invades Poland.
      Hitler felt that .de's strategic position was pretty good and that it was the right time to do it. Looking at the map, he got rid of the Czechs and signed a pact of non aggression with Russia, aiming to divide poland into two. Only significant challenge would come from Fr & UK, and he thought they would not move quickly, and that the US had no intention to intervene in Europe.
      Still a huge gamble on Hitler's part. .de was militarily strong but unable to wage a long lasting war; economically .de was no match for Fr & UK.

    The Polish plan
      Initially the pl army looked strong on paper, 1 million strong, but in reality Poland's flatness and was surrounded by points from which the germans can invade. 
      The Poles placed most of their troops at the border, to protect the rest of the country, but unfortunately for them they got screwed by the speed of the blitz.

    Blitzkrieg applied to Poland:
      No war declaration, and due to UK & Fr pressure Pl wasn't fully mobilised.
      Air force was the most important supporting element, bombing cities and civilians.
      The armies were mismatched, as Poles were limited to cavalry units.

    The invasion of France
      Invasion of Pl didn't say much, as their army wasn't that advanced. Sure we won there, but what about Fr? Fr at the time had the reputation of having the most powerful army in the world.

      Proved to be the most humiliating defeat in Fr history, as it took .de less time than it took to defeat Poland.
      Why did it happen?
	1919-1930
	  During the 20s, Fr is mostly preoccupied by its security, being concerned with Germany rising once again. Not as economically powerful or as populous.
	  In 1914 they allied with Russia, seeking to open another front on .de's eastern front.
	  Post ww1, chance of allying with Russia is nil. Seeking more alliances, they sign mil alliances w/Czechs, Pl

	  National mindset over the years migrated from an offensive strategy into a defensive mindset.
	  "The object of our mil org is to protect our borders and defend our overseas territories" - 1927

	  By 1939 fr army was very flawed, with a paralyzed high command and contradictory political interventions. They were also suffering a moral crisis due to ww1 losses (1.4 million young men), where they were not prepared to fight yet another long war.

	1930-1939
	  Germany is obv. a threat again.
	  Unable to win a war alone, they build the maginot line, a line of fortification built between 1930-1935. However, they only built it along the german border, running out of money just before they hit the border along belgium.

	French army 1939-1940
	  After invasion of Pl, Fr PM asked his commanders - are we ready to fight? Yes, but only a defensive war, beginning a misunderstanding.
	  Looking very impressive on paper, unfortunately they coul only gather 1.5 million.
	  While in 1918 they had the largest airforce, but by 1939 it was completely obsolete.
	  Very scattered decision making process, detached from the front line.
	  Faulty mil doctrine - concept of 'methodical battle'. Instead of autonomous, small tank divisions, they scattered tanks around the battlefield to support infantry.
	  Faulty plan around the Dyle; thinking protected by the maginot line and thinking they had an impassable border with luxembourg, when they invaded through .be they would be met with top French units. Except, in Jan 1940 Gen. Manstein introduces a different invasion route and hit them at the most vulnerable point in the Ardennes, despite difficult terrain.
	  Caught by surprise in the ardenne, they encircled the french army stuck in Belgium and marched on Paris. 4 weeks post invasion they sign armistice.

	Explaining .de victory
	  The greatest german weapon was surprise, attacking where they wre not supposed to.
	  fr unable to quickly adapt.
      
      Operation Barbarossa
	With the success of the French invasion. the blitz becomes std mil doctrine and decide it'd be a good idea to fuck with the USSR.

Wanted to cut off britain
Options:
  A siege
  Establishing air superiority over south eastern england
  Diplomatic effort over july 1940 hoping brits would come to their senses.

  Ultimate decided to bomb the fuck out of them.

Germans bombed the living shit out of guernica

German airforce (luftwafte) in 1940
  15 thou officers, 400,000 men.
  both a political and a mil weapon
  By the time Hitler rose to power in 33, the core of the luftwaffe existed and in 35 became a separate branch of the Wehrmacht (armed forces).

  Wehrmacht plagued with problems. Herman Goring appointed commander in chief of Luftwaffe. An early follower, turns out no the best of choices and was a pompous ass, creating many problems within the Air Force.

  36, Raf got reorged into commands
    Bomber
    Fighter
    Coastal
    Training

      Fighter command  gets new commander in chief in 36
	Something of an advantage.
	Get new planes, hurricane, spitfires superior to contemprorary german planes
	Hugh Dowding puts emphasis on new aircraft. Why don't we also build bombers? No, lets focus on building figthers, cos we'll need them.
	He also created a new air defense system, the Dowding system, still being used by all major airforces.

	Relies on a number of factors:
	  1 - Radar a brand new tech, giving them advance warning and direction of invaders.
	  2 - Information followed through by observers and a very flexible system.

Germans very complacent, as impressive as it looked in 1940, the *long-term state* of the Luftwaffe could be characterised by a simple sentence: "too little too late".

Germans were slow to increase aircraft production, with the British outpacing them for most of the war. Only designed for a short term war.

Operation "sealion"
  Idea was to get rid of british airforce, so you could proceed with actual invasion. Nazis tho didn't understand the economics of the war, but the 2nd problem was that it got planned really quickly, over a couple of weeks. Just not enough to proceed w/such a huge operation.
  As comparison, when allies landed thru normandy, they planned for two full years.

  German navy were like, dudes don't forget about the british navy. THey ain't gonna sit around waiting around. Very rigid plan, unflexible, poor logistical planning, got fucked by brit navy waiting around.

  Also, eventually, Hitler gets real complacent and makes lots of blunders (being the supreme mil commander).

  THE actual battle

  The battle can be divided into four phases. 
    10 July - 11 August: Kanalkampf, the channel battles
      .de tried to target any brit ship in the channel and destroy them
    12 August - 23 August Alderangriff, the early assault against the coastal airfields.
    24 August - 6 September The Luftwaffe targets the airfields. Critical phae of the battle.
      Not just on the coast but on the south as well. Even tho the dowding system was pretty flexible, they're going to ground all the aircraft and lose pilots. At the same time, the germans were also losing a lot of aircraft and pilots, hoping to win decisively by early Sept. Had they kept the airfield strategy within a week or two they would've won the battle of britain, but something is going to happen! around Sept6
      7 September onwards: Day attacks switch to London.
	Costliest blunder during the battle. Hitler gave the order to now focus all energy on british cities, particularly London and target civilians instead of the airfields, allowing them to rebuild and keep fighting.

	A battalion accidentally bombs London; until that point Hitler had insisted on not attacking cities. The British retaliate, even if it's symbolic, and decide to do a bombing raid on Berlin. This infuriated Hitler, and switches the strategy to target civilians.

	17 September, Operation Sealion was postponed indefinitely.
	  But by this point Hitler already planning invasion of USSR.
	  UK still standing, and now more resolved on fighting than ever.
	  Germans initiate a siege of the UK.

@jan 28

uh the battle of the atlantic.
four phases? last one in 1941 dec with entry of US into war

climaxes in early 1943 when germans start losing battle of atlantic cos of mass production of liberty ships and economic might of the US, and a change in strategy allowed them to sink more uboats than were being built.

only once the atlantic got secured were the UK and US free to launch their armies against german occupied europe.

@feb 2

identify people invovled in document
date & circumstances surrounding the document
identify the main themes
conclusion

fr govt as a result of german advance, was exremely divided with two main trends: we have to keep on fighting even if the fr govt has to leave france. 2nd trend, growing as germans are advancing, we have to surrender to stop the useless fighting.

people get their document and start writing immediately.
you have about two hours, read the document first, underline main ideas, then pen an outline before starting. if you dont you're going tobe very disjointed.
