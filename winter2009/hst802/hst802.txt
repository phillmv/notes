the origins of the ww2

what happened? great war was supposed to be eoall war.

1919-1930s post ww1 era mgmt
early 1930s-1939 follow major downturn in 1929, things get rough, rise of national socialism.

The legacy of ww1 1919-1930
  nov11 1918 eoww1.
  Even though it was over, the war was still going on in central europe.
  Real problem in 1919 the disappearance of Austria Hungary, leaving behind a mass of small countries with conflicts over borders. Throughout 1920s war is waged over these borders.

  Paris peace conf
    major flaws:
      A congress of victors, a first in european history. previously, at the end of a war, all of the participants would gather and discuss the peace process. in 1815, napoleon lost finally and so in vienna peace conference france was invited. In Paris, Germany isn't invited until the end when it was time to sign the treaty, provoking a lot of resentment.
      All the major decisions were made by the council of Four (US, UK, FR, IT).
      Consequently, it looked like a Diktat, or 'imposed settlement'.

    Germany treated as the guilty party
      considered the sole cause, which allowed for
	- losing territories (Alsace-Lorraine, Polish corridor isolating east prussia). 10% of German territory, population, lost.
	- forced to disarm and demobolise its army down to 100,000 men. Eventually fuels resentment as .de is circled by powerful armies.
	- forced to pay war reparations, somehow.

      Western powers showed little sense of solidarity amongst themselves. 
	Disagreed on almost everything.
	Allied diplomacy greatly underestimated the problem of enforcement. Initially starting out to reform IR and present some form of collective security, except UK and FR had no intention to reform ways and removed all teeth from the League of Nations.
	UK worried eowar, now that .de is srsly weakened, that FR would become too powerful. UK FP based on 'balance of power', where no single nation on eu continent should dominate whole of europe.
	Highly suspicious at US commitment to change IR. Proven right as eventually US would not ratify treaty of versailles.
	Marshal Foch: "This is not peace; it is an Armistice for twenty years"

      Left with a series of countries who wouldn't mind repealing the treaty.

  The question of war reparations
    Article in treaty, .de "guilty of starting ww1", ergo must bear the consequences. At not time did .de want to pay these hefty reparations.
    Between the two wars, history of eu dominated by this issue.
    
    War reparations tied to another problem:
      - war debts; how did the FR and the UK manage to pay for their war effort? They borrowed heavily from the US. By eoww1, hugely in debt and war reparations appealing. 

    German inflation spikes and the economy is in shambles; UK & US are lenient but FR is having none of this and invade the Ruhr (the industrial heartland) in 1923. FR ultimately forced to leave.

  Resurgence of Germany
    mid 1920s, a new foreign minister Gustav Stresemann comes in.
      Taking advantage of UK/FR animosity, he plays them against each other. Seeking a compromise on issue of reparations, he convinces his debtors to go for international arbitration, calling in the US. Charles Dawes sits with UK and Fr and reach a compromise to pay until 1988. 
      Stresemann approaches US and says, if our economy is ruined we might actually have to undergo a revolution and become communist! That would be bad. Plz help us streghten our economy with some nice loans? US says sure!, as a stronger europe means more markets to exploit. New loans allowed them to repay reparations and bootstrap economy.
      Stresemann agrees to sign the Locarno pact with the French, recognising the border b/w FR and .de, finally stabilising relations.

  The EOVersailles treaty and the failure of collective security
    League of Nations
      war as last resort; 
      despite being started by Wilson, US never participates not wanting to get involved in other's affairs.
      only nations involved UK and FR, as IT, JP and DE leave in early 1930s
      League never possessed the means to enforce its own sanctions.

      - First challenge comes in 1931 as JP invades Manchuria.
	  JP reprimanded by League, and they leave.
      - Then, invasion of Ethiopia in 1935 by IT
	  One of the few indie African countries, Italy is all like why hullo thar and adds them to their colonies.
	  Emperor of Ethiopia travels to Geneva to plead his case and ask for help. UK and FR bicker over what to do, disagreeing, don't even apply sanction against Italy. Italy is just reprimanded, and they leave the League.

      Should League of Nations be an instrument of conciliation or a machine of security?

    The Great Depression and the Rise of Hitler to Power.
      1929 opened a world of pain, trashing .de and its US loans.
      1933 Hitler rose to power, one of first FP decisions pulls out of League of Nations.
	UK & FR, would the USSR be a counterweight to Hitler? Unwilling to compromise with the Bolsheviks, that fails.
      By 1920s, disarment talk fails as Hitler begins rearmament in 1930s.

    Remilitarization of the Rhineland
      Following Versailles, no .de troops were allowed in the Rhineland. Hitler quickly remilitarises the region. 
      FR & UK do nothing, allowing Hitler to grow in confidence.

    The Anschluss in 1938
      merger of germany and austria
	int'l reaction? Bad germans! Did nothing.
	Paralyzed by prospect of ww2.

  Why did Western Democracies not understand Hitler?
    FR & UK FP dominated by a double fear:
      Fear of war; srsly did not want to go to war again. FR lost so much in ww1 they developed conflict phobia, over 1.4 million soldiers. Ditto in UK, leading to a policy of appeasement.
      Fear of communism; Western democracies more worried about rise of USSR than Nazi Germany. Many ppl believed that .de would stand against threat of Commies; better the fascists than the commies sweeping through the rest of Europe.

  1938: the turning point
    German concept of 'peaceful aggression'. Hitler pretty pleased; basically, a combination of bluffing and threats. 
    Working beautifully since 1933, why stop? By 1938, Nazis had no intention at starting global war; Hitler's goal ultimately todestroy treaty of Versailles. 
    
    Next target was Czechoslovakia. 
      Why?
	Sudetenland populated by majority of Germans, nation created by Versailles. 
      Well armed and prepared to defend themselves, they built a powerful line of fortifications along the .de border. Also, the Czechs signed a formal .mil alliance with France. Germans are aware of this, so how are FR and UK going to react? All signs pointed to war.

      FR war phobic and more prepared to defend themselves. Initially prepared to intervene, but ultimately ready to forego its .mil alliances.

    Munich agreement in 1938
      UK & FR completely abandon Czechoslovakia, give it over to DE.
      Famous statement by Chamberlain, 'peace for our time', waving a paper signed by Hitler.
      Not seen very kindly by USSR.

      Ultimately, a recipe for disaster:
	FR & UK cross a new threshold in their appeasement, losing all credibility after abandoning their agreements, causing other countries to think twice before signing an agreement with UK & FR.
	FR & UK say, at the very least, we gained some time. We now know that Hitler is dangerous, we can now embark on rearmament. Problem was, Germans were also rearming very quickly. Germans were able to study French built line of fortifications in Czechoslovakia and learn its weakness. Czech army absorbed into DE army.
	USSR says, fuck those guys, decides to negotiate with Germans as well. 
	  In last days of Aug 1939 USSR DE sign non agression pact.
	
	Hitler's popularity explodes in Germany, doing whatever he pleases without consequences.
	Munich agreement led to war the following war, as Hitler becomes convinced that his peaceful aggression would work continuously and targets Poland.
	Problem was, after invading all of CZ, British and French stop believing they can avoid war permanently.

      Two days after DE invades Poland, FR & UK declare war.

# ah getting in late...

collective bonds to unite people;
hitler had mass rallies

use of propaganda to move opinion.

The vision of the 'new man'
  In .de - Creation of the new man who is going to be perfect, ostracizing the jews and idealizing 'the nordic ideal' blonde blue eyed man, racially pure.

  In USSR - 'classless society'. 

A charismatic leader
  vision of leader as a saviour. 
  Hitler when he gave a speech he would build up momentum in his speech, shouting by the end of it, mesmerizing his audience.
  Mussolini, similarly.

The one party state
  Create a new elite and new state ideology.
  Systematic censorship & propaganda allows the building of a consensus.
  Also builds a war philosophy.
    Basically, these totalitarian regimes have war at their essence, magnifying the perceived external threat in order to enhance internal cohesion, and promoting war as a means to purify society.
    Hitler said very early on that he was preparing for war.

  In art, 'nazi' promoting fatherland ideals vs 'degenerate' art.


The rise of communism in EEurope fuelled fascism.
  Although they had lots in common they hated each other.
  The failed communist revolution in HUngary led to a fascist regime.
  A general strike in Italy (Oct '22), dominated by It Commies, led to Mussolini's 'March On Rome'
  In Germany, the strenght of the Commies frightened the German conservatives and industrialists and led them to hand over power to Hitler.

Italy in the 1920s: The Cradle of Fascism

  'after all, it was [Mussolini] who shoed us that everything was possible'

Do remember, Hitler rose to power democratic means.

The Nazi Party
  Did poor in 1928 general elections.
  Yet in 1932 Nazi party had become the main political party in the land.
    Why?
      Economic downturn hit Germany particularly hard, being dependent on American loans which dried up immediately after the '29 crash. 
      Added to Versailles resentment, you have a perfect opportunity for hard liners to emerge.
      In 1935 the Nazi party flag became the German national flag in 1935.
  In 1932, #2 were the German commies, in GElections.
    Fearing the influence of Communism, German elites give the chancellorship to Hitler.

    One of the first actions the Nazis took was to burn down the Reichstag, the national parliament, blaming it on the Commies, basically ending the Commie Party in Germany.
      Hitler declares a state of emergency and assumes dictatorial powers, and from that point on Germany becomes a one-state party, and begin their plans for national cohesion.

  From '33-39, the Nazis gradually organize military parades, pick on the jews as the national scapegoat, agenda of spreading territory for breeding space.

  Hitler was ultimately convinced that FR & UK would not intervene.

Next week on monday, the initial victories of Germany.
