Science Fiction
  1. Hard sf
    Associated with Wells, Asimov, Clark (classics). 

    a. From Wells onwards tied closely to science in subject mtter and in narrative in the way its told. the writing itself seems to be founded on methodology method and logic of scientific experiment, important to wells thematically, plot. In their writing hard sf writers tend to be quite faithful to the laws of universe as known at the time (obv. subject to changes over time, i..e Wells vs Asimov). Tend to have a rigorous alliegence to sci accuracy, wanted scientifically plausible which must come from logical consequences, no flights of fancy, or it has to *feel* that way, in the way its written, logical outcomes from physical constants in the world. Big sf fans love finding the places where the writer had slipped and some inconsistency.
    
    b. Hard sf tends to value versimilitude (feeling real). Narrative voice (implied), or an actual character tends to be very practical and pragmatic. It's matter-of-fact about the science, a lot of concrete description; Wells does this to almost an extreme extent in the time machine as he explains exactly how it could happen. Very meticulous, partly how the reality effect is created. The plot tends to be science-drive, wonders of science and science itself is a character moving the plot forward. More interested in the physical than the social or psychological world, outward directed. Higher focus on sciences that operate on physical world.
    
    c. Grows out of an enlightment (18th century where religion gets replaced w/science as the basis through which people interact in the world. In mid ages i.e. the world around us not as important as the world to come, seen even in architecture, medieval cities being very slapdash because this world was not that important, afterlife better. Around 18th century this starts to shift, so suddenly ppl are paying attn to outer world, like with da vinci who is concerned with flying and how the body functions, *stuff*, our world). Hard sf tends to view the lws of the universe as constant, and those are its origins, and the idea that the world can be described accurate and events predicted scientifically. Even when we get into quantum world in 20th centurythere is still a great allegience that you could describe this and figure it out - nothing that is mystical. 
      
      The greatest wonder is to be discovered pondering the physical nature of the universe. This in itself is wondrous enough, no need for complex characters; it is enough to ponder this world that surrounds us. 
    
    Wells is the father of this type, you could go back to frankenstein but it is in many ways a romance novel despite the monster, Wells is seen as the beginning tho the term doesnt develop till the '20s.

  2. Speculative fiction / Fantasy

    Marge Percy woman on edge of time; Octavia Butlers, Kindred (afro american pulled into past to rescue white slave owning ancestor so she could be born). Less concerned with HOW but with WHAT happens and her predicament and what she does then.

    a. Extrapolates from existing conditions, takes a set of circumstances and imagines into the future or another place or into the past or different conditions in our own world. Uses std plot devices like time travel or alien worlds or unfamiliar worlds, there are scientists all over the place, we can have spaceships, gadgetry and problems are usually still worked out in some logical fashion but there is less concern about the plausibility of the events re: the physical world. Not going to explain how somthing always happens, etc. 

    b. Still have that lang of science, science type people like anthropologists or doctors. Still an attempt to make the world plausible; we're not being mystical. One diff is that it tends to be very much character driven. In Kindred, it is very much about the protagonist's internal struggle, and her struggle with her ancestor, who is not a nice guy but she needs to keep saving over and over again. Her struggle with other slaves, etc, the things Octavia Butler tends to be interested in. Tends to be more concerned with plot, more literary, style, char development. Whereas hard sf tends to have stock characeters ("the medical man, the physicist").

    c. More interested in psychology, social experiments than in fidelity to science (no longer the most important thing). Primary focus on social extrapolation, what if these relations b/w people, utter complete gender equality, what if women/men dying off (fave of 1970s fem utopias). Internal driven, people are feeling/thinking as opposed to external driven where are you going who are you fighting. She thinks that hard sf is didactic - let me teach you about science, but speculative didactive diff lets teach you a moral lesson, about behaviour (i.e. humans meet aliens, how ppl react, etc). Often talks about a world that can or should change socially, how the economy is going, class relations, this is all brought up to the forefront.


  Post-modern sci fi
    William Gibson, Neuromancer (fabulous)
    Gibson on one end and Butler on the other end re: world view
    
    a. Gibson tends to use sciency language but not that concerned with accuracy, lots of jargon that sounds very intimidating but may really not mean much at all. Pomo tends to be very tecnhophilic, loves gadgets, loves machine human interface - cyberpunk (which basically gibson invented) falls under this rubric and it loves its toys.

    b. Concerned more with a surface, techno style. Very gritty, a lot of overwhelming details but the diff is someone like Gibson or Sterling is not going to spell it out for you like Wells (who wants to walk you through how it makes sense) where a lot of cyperunk/pomo you ar e just dropped into this world where nothing is explained and you gotta figure it out, a club you're in or out. Some focus on characters but again they tend to be very stock, i.e. the alienated young man and recently the alienated young woman. Often set in the near future. Wells who carries us to apocalyptic end of the universe or the time of dinosaurs; tends to be just a lil bit in the future i.e. blade runner, things have changed just enough for some cognitive dissonance. 

    c. Tends to express this alienation from existing conditions, pessimist about future/human nature. Basically the world is a hostile place and the plot is often the main character's attempts to navigate through this place - not necessary in a reputable or morally admirable way.

  a - Relation to science
  b - Aesthetics (nature of narrative, characterization, etc)
  c - Ideology behind it
      Pomo tends to be about alienation, etc.
  
  Two main approaches: the narrative itself, the plot, the characters; the other is looking at the work within its historical context and understanding it within that context. Really focusing on how these works are products of hopes and anxieties of the time in which they are written. We can't pull them completely out and talk about Gibson or Wells as if they werent a product of their moment in time. Some of the big questions are 'what makes us human' and in many cases where do we define our humanity?, from the actual limits of the human say in Ghost in The Shell. Talk about class and power relations, in Wells consideration of class, in Kindred power relations in context of race and obviously humans and technology.
  You go from Wells who has a handy machine, but it's a tool. In cyberpunk the machine is part of the human, no clear line b/w the two, and this can cause a lot of anxiety. Some gender politics as well.

  So, 'The Time Machine' extrapolates from the class conditions of Wells' time. At the time he writes this (which he later recants, being very ideologically wishy washy), he's a v. committed socialist and what he's seeing is a widening class division and the condition of the minors are very drastic and so he takes this with his two races - the underground dwellers and the above ground ones.
  'The day the earth stood still', apart from being too awesome, it really is a product of its historical moment in this case the cold war. The whole thing is a cipher for antagonism bw US and USSR which is just starting to consolidate itself. It uses a ind of allegory to talk about the tensions b/w these two ideologies and world views.
  'Fahrenheit 451' written in fifties but takes up a diff anxiety, about a visual media replacing books, a disspearance of literature and reading.

  What Gibson talks, what happens when identity gets partially spearated from the body, interacting in cyberspace, how important is our body to our identity? There's a character whose mind is preserved in a metal box, and he's not thriving; immortal but not thriving. 

  Also do 'Ghost in The Shell', which is v. important for genre of anime, and so clearly treats the limits of humans and the machine.

  Terms: 
    1. Extrapolation
      From existing social, political, economic conditions imagining a progression to what they might be - into another time, another world, a difference set of circumstances, it can have to do w/physics or psychology. A pretty broad set of possibilities.
      In a sense all works of fiction do this, but sci fi does this in the most radical way. Examples:
	Class relations
	Gender relations
	Economic developments
	Technological developments

	What creates these anxieties?
	  Anxiety about increasing div b/w rich and poor
	  Ideal of gender equality
	  Climate will get increasingly unstable
	  Fait in/fear of medical advances

	Fictional projection based on these hopes and anxieties.
	  Class war
	  Males all die off
	  Canada becomes only source of water
	  Medical advances conquer disease

      Outcome
	(basically the narrative)
	  Two classes become two species
	  All female utopia is achieved
	  Canada invaded by US
	  Immortality is achieved

    2. Defamilairization
      to create distance; all lit does this, as its made up, but sci fi depends very much, this is its strength, it creates this distance which allows us to get a bit of removal from the everyday
	New, unfamiliar species
	Time warps - future or past
	Unfamiliar terrain

	Cognitive Dissonance
	  challenges our assumptions

    3. Thought Experiments
      What if?
	Travel to the future
	Create a basically human AI
	Apocalypse
	Encountered aliens

	Meet yourself in the future
	AI's take over the future
	Humans reduced to primitve conditions
	Exploration spaceship makes contact with aliens

      Fictional Experiment
	Attempts to avoid future self
	Human being become underclass
	Rebuilding society
	war w/aliens

      Conclusions
	not necessarily, okay! here's the moral of the story, but its often implicit
	  time travel is a bad idea
	  it's dangerous to create AI's
	  Humankind is resilient
	  Humans can't deal with "otherness"
