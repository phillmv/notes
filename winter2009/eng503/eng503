Science Fiction
  1. Hard sf
    Associated with Wells, Asimov, Clark (classics). 

    a. From Wells onwards tied closely to science in subject mtter and in narrative in the way its told. the writing itself seems to be founded on methodology method and logic of scientific experiment, important to wells thematically, plot. In their writing hard sf writers tend to be quite faithful to the laws of universe as known at the time (obv. subject to changes over time, i..e Wells vs Asimov). Tend to have a rigorous alliegence to sci accuracy, wanted scientifically plausible which must come from logical consequences, no flights of fancy, or it has to *feel* that way, in the way its written, logical outcomes from physical constants in the world. Big sf fans love finding the places where the writer had slipped and some inconsistency.
    
    b. Hard sf tends to value versimilitude (feeling real). Narrative voice (implied), or an actual character tends to be very practical and pragmatic. It's matter-of-fact about the science, a lot of concrete description; Wells does this to almost an extreme extent in the time machine as he explains exactly how it could happen. Very meticulous, partly how the reality effect is created. The plot tends to be science-drive, wonders of science and science itself is a character moving the plot forward. More interested in the physical than the social or psychological world, outward directed. Higher focus on sciences that operate on physical world.
    
    c. Grows out of an enlightment (18th century where religion gets replaced w/science as the basis through which people interact in the world. In mid ages i.e. the world around us not as important as the world to come, seen even in architecture, medieval cities being very slapdash because this world was not that important, afterlife better. Around 18th century this starts to shift, so suddenly ppl are paying attn to outer world, like with da vinci who is concerned with flying and how the body functions, *stuff*, our world). Hard sf tends to view the lws of the universe as constant, and those are its origins, and the idea that the world can be described accurate and events predicted scientifically. Even when we get into quantum world in 20th centurythere is still a great allegience that you could describe this and figure it out - nothing that is mystical. 
      
      The greatest wonder is to be discovered pondering the physical nature of the universe. This in itself is wondrous enough, no need for complex characters; it is enough to ponder this world that surrounds us. 
    
    Wells is the father of this type, you could go back to frankenstein but it is in many ways a romance novel despite the monster, Wells is seen as the beginning tho the term doesnt develop till the '20s.

  2. Speculative fiction / Fantasy

    Marge Percy woman on edge of time; Octavia Butlers, Kindred (afro american pulled into past to rescue white slave owning ancestor so she could be born). Less concerned with HOW but with WHAT happens and her predicament and what she does then.

    a. Extrapolates from existing conditions, takes a set of circumstances and imagines into the future or another place or into the past or different conditions in our own world. Uses std plot devices like time travel or alien worlds or unfamiliar worlds, there are scientists all over the place, we can have spaceships, gadgetry and problems are usually still worked out in some logical fashion but there is less concern about the plausibility of the events re: the physical world. Not going to explain how somthing always happens, etc. 

    b. Still have that lang of science, science type people like anthropologists or doctors. Still an attempt to make the world plausible; we're not being mystical. One diff is that it tends to be very much character driven. In Kindred, it is very much about the protagonist's internal struggle, and her struggle with her ancestor, who is not a nice guy but she needs to keep saving over and over again. Her struggle with other slaves, etc, the things Octavia Butler tends to be interested in. Tends to be more concerned with plot, more literary, style, char development. Whereas hard sf tends to have stock characeters ("the medical man, the physicist").

    c. More interested in psychology, social experiments than in fidelity to science (no longer the most important thing). Primary focus on social extrapolation, what if these relations b/w people, utter complete gender equality, what if women/men dying off (fave of 1970s fem utopias). Internal driven, people are feeling/thinking as opposed to external driven where are you going who are you fighting. She thinks that hard sf is didactic - let me teach you about science, but speculative didactive diff lets teach you a moral lesson, about behaviour (i.e. humans meet aliens, how ppl react, etc). Often talks about a world that can or should change socially, how the economy is going, class relations, this is all brought up to the forefront.


  Post-modern sci fi
    William Gibson, Neuromancer (fabulous)
    Gibson on one end and Butler on the other end re: world view
    
    a. Gibson tends to use sciency language but not that concerned with accuracy, lots of jargon that sounds very intimidating but may really not mean much at all. Pomo tends to be very tecnhophilic, loves gadgets, loves machine human interface - cyberpunk (which basically gibson invented) falls under this rubric and it loves its toys.

    b. Concerned more with a surface, techno style. Very gritty, a lot of overwhelming details but the diff is someone like Gibson or Sterling is not going to spell it out for you like Wells (who wants to walk you through how it makes sense) where a lot of cyperunk/pomo you ar e just dropped into this world where nothing is explained and you gotta figure it out, a club you're in or out. Some focus on characters but again they tend to be very stock, i.e. the alienated young man and recently the alienated young woman. Often set in the near future. Wells who carries us to apocalyptic end of the universe or the time of dinosaurs; tends to be just a lil bit in the future i.e. blade runner, things have changed just enough for some cognitive dissonance. 

    c. Tends to express this alienation from existing conditions, pessimist about future/human nature. Basically the world is a hostile place and the plot is often the main character's attempts to navigate through this place - not necessary in a reputable or morally admirable way.

  a - Relation to science
  b - Aesthetics (nature of narrative, characterization, etc)
  c - Ideology behind it
      Pomo tends to be about alienation, etc.
  
  Two main approaches: the narrative itself, the plot, the characters; the other is looking at the work within its historical context and understanding it within that context. Really focusing on how these works are products of hopes and anxieties of the time in which they are written. We can't pull them completely out and talk about Gibson or Wells as if they werent a product of their moment in time. Some of the big questions are 'what makes us human' and in many cases where do we define our humanity?, from the actual limits of the human say in Ghost in The Shell. Talk about class and power relations, in Wells consideration of class, in Kindred power relations in context of race and obviously humans and technology.
  You go from Wells who has a handy machine, but it's a tool. In cyberpunk the machine is part of the human, no clear line b/w the two, and this can cause a lot of anxiety. Some gender politics as well.

  So, 'The Time Machine' extrapolates from the class conditions of Wells' time. At the time he writes this (which he later recants, being very ideologically wishy washy), he's a v. committed socialist and what he's seeing is a widening class division and the condition of the minors are very drastic and so he takes this with his two races - the underground dwellers and the above ground ones.
  'The day the earth stood still', apart from being too awesome, it really is a product of its historical moment in this case the cold war. The whole thing is a cipher for antagonism bw US and USSR which is just starting to consolidate itself. It uses a ind of allegory to talk about the tensions b/w these two ideologies and world views.
  'Fahrenheit 451' written in fifties but takes up a diff anxiety, about a visual media replacing books, a disspearance of literature and reading.

  What Gibson talks, what happens when identity gets partially spearated from the body, interacting in cyberspace, how important is our body to our identity? There's a character whose mind is preserved in a metal box, and he's not thriving; immortal but not thriving. 

  Also do 'Ghost in The Shell', which is v. important for genre of anime, and so clearly treats the limits of humans and the machine.

  Terms: 
    1. Extrapolation
      From existing social, political, economic conditions imagining a progression to what they might be - into another time, another world, a difference set of circumstances, it can have to do w/physics or psychology. A pretty broad set of possibilities.
      In a sense all works of fiction do this, but sci fi does this in the most radical way. Examples:
	Class relations
	Gender relations
	Economic developments
	Technological developments

	What creates these anxieties?
	  Anxiety about increasing div b/w rich and poor
	  Ideal of gender equality
	  Climate will get increasingly unstable
	  Fait in/fear of medical advances

	Fictional projection based on these hopes and anxieties.
	  Class war
	  Males all die off
	  Canada becomes only source of water
	  Medical advances conquer disease

      Outcome
	(basically the narrative)
	  Two classes become two species
	  All female utopia is achieved
	  Canada invaded by US
	  Immortality is achieved

    2. Defamilairization
      to create distance; all lit does this, as its made up, but sci fi depends very much, this is its strength, it creates this distance which allows us to get a bit of removal from the everyday
	New, unfamiliar species
	Time warps - future or past
	Unfamiliar terrain

	Cognitive Dissonance
	  challenges our assumptions

    3. Thought Experiments
      What if?
	Travel to the future
	Create a basically human AI
	Apocalypse
	Encountered aliens

	Meet yourself in the future
	AI's take over the future
	Humans reduced to primitve conditions
	Exploration spaceship makes contact with aliens

      Fictional Experiment
	Attempts to avoid future self
	Human being become underclass
	Rebuilding society
	war w/aliens

      Conclusions
	not necessarily, okay! here's the moral of the story, but its often implicit
	  time travel is a bad idea
	  it's dangerous to create AI's
	  Humankind is resilient
	  Humans can't deal with "otherness"

Next time: HGWells Time Machine upto chapt 2

@jan 13

Sophocles
  Oedipus Rex goes to Thebes but can't get in cos theres this massive Sphinx guarding it, unless he answers a particular riddle. If you don't answer correctly he gets eaten. 

  What would be evident to Wells' readers is how this riddle is used by Thomas Carlyse in 'Past and Present'. 
  carlyse introduces another sphinx but for himt he riddle is what to do with the working class. It's appropriate in a way that Wells would use this symbol. Carlyse has a slightly diff take on it; both talk about how put down the working class is, Carlyse talks about the responsiblity of the captains of industry to take care of the working class. 

  Other context for decadence is decadent art that emphasizes self indulgence, aesthetics, content, effort.

  Establishes narrative logic with other assumptions and interpretations, and everytime he gives us an interpretation he says but how wrong I was! dun dun dun duuuun. 

  He meets the Eloi; they are unconcerned, flower children. 

  Hypothesis by the Time Traveler
    1. A kind of Eden; he's sitting at the top of a hill looking out at this kind of vista, "it was as sweet and fair view as I have ever seen".
      A kind of statis-complacency, how they've lost necessity. 
      
    2. Two species theory. He realises after seeing the Morlocks and understands them that he has not this eden with a race of Eloi achieving some kind of stasis but rather two species where the morlocks constitute the underclass who have literally been driven underground.
      The Eloi are dominant.

    3. Morlock's ascendent. 
      Oops, I think I know what the Morlocks are eating. The Eloi are the ones who have become the victims and is split between disgust and a recognition that the Eloi kind of got what they deserved.

@jan 28

klaatu is a sympathetic figure, and the viewer is encouraged to identify with him instead of the media misrepresenting him and the army chasing him.

We in the audience know that he's a regular guy and there's this ironic dist that makes us suspicious of the media. In case thats not enough he's also represented as a kind of christ figure. Her question to us now is, in what respect what did we notice about his story that makes him into a christ like figure.

in day earth stood still,

klaatu - justice, US
earth - USSR/all rogue nations
Fed of Planets - UN/NATO
gort - atomic bomb

Different text.
Written at almost the same time, 1953, it has a v. different preoccupation. It picks up some of the themes of both the time machine and the day the earth stood still. Fahrenheit 451.

Similar themes w/time machine
- consumed by entertainment/leisure
  loss of knowledge, dumbing down, in particular of history
power relations
  class
  gov't/fire fighters
    People are being actively controlled and oppressed.
post-literate societies
  - in TM books literally crumbled to dust over 800k years
  - in F451 books are being burned, actively destroyed
language makes us human

whole story is about montag learning about literature.
In f451 the govt wants to keep people in the eternal present and hamstring any kind of social transformation. If you can't imagine anything other than what exists right now, there is no understanding on how to make things different and bradbury makes his claim that one way of understanding this is thru literature.


FF - active coercion
FF - active witness, part of society

TM - outsider, evolution/devolution
In f451 it's all about the protagonist and his journey from an enforcer to a kind of rebel.

What about the nature of the devolution?

psychologically vs physically devolved. In case of TM, traditionaly hard sci fi long periods of time, where as in f451 time frame much more compressed. Don't look any different physically.
active resistence vs passive acceptance.


both books have this female character who introduces the conflict and guide the plot.

@feb 2

mildred represents this deep disatisfaction that underlies people n this society. you dont attempt suicide unless you're at the point of despair, tho she doesn't remember clearly at some unconscious level that she's desperate.

something is very very wrong, something we don't see in the time machine. because theres this deep disatisfaction it suggest possibility for change. ofc we also see montg dev this sense first with his encounter with clarice,

she introduces this very inconvenient question, are you happy?
by pg 12 he felt his smile slide away, melt, fold over down on itself like a tallow skin, like the stuff of a fantastic candle blown out, darkness. he was not happy. 

beaty clearly has a couple of functions, clearly acts as his super ego, keeping him in line, but he also acts as a kind of explicator, to explain how tihs society came about, with these extended monologues with beaty. Another diff from the tm where we have a char who undergoes all these hypothesis trying to get it right, here we have someone who delivers the history to montag.

going back to the start, we have this symbol of the hearth and the salamander. 

Hearth
  Home (Hearth & home)
    the place around which everyone gathers.
    images of fire, but fire as warmth, comfort, this idea of everyone gathering togehter as one, a company, a collective, the idea of fire as warmth. 
Fire  
   how is this kind of ironic, in our context with the book?
     fire as destruction, we know right from the very beginning that we're not talking abot a warming fire.
   a kind of negative cleansing

How about the salamander?
  live in/through fire
  a reptilian association - the hose described as a great python, spitting fire, the device the techs use to pump millie's stomach is a black cobra.

  Then we have the electric hound
    dogs
      loyalty, they'll go so far to save you, protect you
      man's best friend
      hunting
      territorial
    electric hound
      search and destroy
      weapon/gort
      superego, guard
      territorial
      technological
	bradley critizing our dependence on technology
      it sleeps but does not sleep! not quite the dogs we know


Sieve and sand
  we witness the continuing transformation of montag's consciousness and we see it coming to a crisis, readying to boil over.
  futile effort, living in the eternal present, no attention span, montag's frustration at his inability to grasp what is true in the world and his situation.

  he's going to be told that lit is essential for functioning for society and told by beaty that its what destroyed society

  millie and her friends
    montag asks her several times, it's about those people, what kind of people who are they? they're those people. Well whats the story about? well he's mad at her, and they're mad, but it's okay in the end. Why are they mad? What's the point? what's the narrative? and this is precisely what millie can't tell him

    there's this scene with a huge emanation of sounds and music from the televisor, yeah it almost feels like something happened? but everything is completely superficial overloading of the senses, standing in the place of genuine narrative.

    they have no clue, don't even care

  what does faber represent?
    conscience - in montage's ear, displacement
    he know he's a coward
    an alternate POV, the traditional values bradbury cleary prefers
    serving as a mentor/catalyst for montage to become enlightened?
      what is that alternate perspective?
	pg 83 do you know why books like this are important? because it has quality, it has texture, features, etc, etc, the good writers touch life writer, the mediocre ones run a quick hand over it, do you now see why books are hated and feared? it shows the pores of life
	books show us not only ourselves, but what life is about, this is essential to our humanity. Beaty would agree, but it's the last thing that we need.

    Beatty
      present
      strong, maybe not intented to identify with him, but he's a strong figure, a tragic figure in the end.
      status quo

@feb4

faber - perspective that values knowledge, history, he's educated, a former professor so he MUST be smart. talks v specifically what it is about literature that allows us to understand life, the world around us, quality txture and pores that literature really gets at. the problem right now, flowers growing on a rock, with no deep roots, implication that media tech are those kind of pretty flowers, where lit has these deep roots. 
He tells montag that there are a numer of things that are required of lit that make it effective, unlike say the fireman rule book, some kind of quality.

We have this scenario of the dueling quotes.

What traitors books can be!

1) Minorities -> empty out content
  it promotes anger, destroys authority 
  beatty becomes a burner of literature cos it betrayed him, a promise of literature. 


Who is to blame?
- in TM we have a very clear group identified, the leisure class
- in Day the Earth Stood still also a very clearly culpable group of people, the people of earth in their agressive nature
- in F451 it's a little more complex. 

1) people - instant gratification
	  - reading is "too hard"
	  - minorities
	  
2) media tech/tv 
  does all of this dumb us down?
    slight contradiction, "it's not books you need its the things that used to be in books, it could be in the parlor families, could be projected thru radios and televisors but they are not"

3) gov't
  in an opportunistic way moves in and takes adv. of people's indifference


pg 115, beatty
what is there about fire that is so lovely, what drwas us to it? it's perpetual motion the thing man wanted to invent but never did, it's a mystery, its real beauty is that it destroys responsibilites and consequences

pg 116

pg 145, 146

the phoenix bit were its reborn

---
destroys responsibility, consequences
  montag, you're a burden!
relieving a burden -> erase -> change
  get rid of the old
turn away from destructive fire
campfire-hearth
phoenix, how we're diff from the phoenix is that we know whats happened in the past, used in a kind of negative way


-- 
Water

Montag is running away, a river is involved, very obv. imagery about rebirth, baptism in the water, and meets away this idealized hobo society.

War

deus ex machina

role of media

he sees himself reflected in all of these televisions, it becomes completely unreal, they kill a fake montag.

At the very end, we have ppl becoming books. Kind of marks the extent of their oppresion, it's so dangerous to own a book that they have to make themselves into books.

it also makes literal of bringing literature to life, of embodying the literature.
