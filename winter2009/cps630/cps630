what is web2.0?
 network effects

Most features talked today should be included in project

netscape - gateway to the internet
  software had to follow lifecycles, compat, installs, patches, etc
google - webservice
  the more you use the better the service becomes
  no upgrades, no extra patches, etc.

service vs product

Akamai - centralised downloads, whereas Bittorrent allows for decentralization: the more people use it, the better it gets.

The architecture of participation
1.0 is about publishing,
2.0 is about participation


web the platform
data is the driving force
architecture of participation
service syndication
democratic vs centralized
social networking


---

our project seeks to collect a wide range of user metrics and information in order to provide a novel way to rank and visualize content that is newsworthy or interesting to the user. We can achieve this etc etc etc.


-- in the future our system could always provide a personalized view to news and newsworthy items.


missing from feature list

data collection engine
 - story views collecting data from
    - clicks, pageviews
    - ignored articles
    - estimated read percentage (how long they are on the page/length of text)
    - number of comments, commenting rate
    - comment contention (thread depth)

Page placement algorithm
  tweakable factors, higher the number 
  decay over time
  score formula: (1/T)(X*clicks + Y*ignores + ...)
