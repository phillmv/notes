what is web2.0?
 network effects

Most features talked today should be included in project

netscape - gateway to the internet
  software had to follow lifecycles, compat, installs, patches, etc
google - webservice
  the more you use the better the service becomes
  no upgrades, no extra patches, etc.

service vs product

Akamai - centralised downloads, whereas Bittorrent allows for decentralization: the more people use it, the better it gets.

The architecture of participation
1.0 is about publishing,
2.0 is about participation


web the platform
data is the driving force
architecture of participation
service syndication
democratic vs centralized
social networking
