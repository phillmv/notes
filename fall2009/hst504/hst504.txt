signups for seminar - two hr block on monday

first for all hst never starts when we say it starts
dates are kind of arbitrary

hst truisms
  exact dates are unimportant
  about themes and ideas, ideas drive history
  pick major intellectual events to launch a course
  don't think of hst as little components; a sort of river in to which all sorts of diff things flow and drive it forward
  n. americans are ahistorical
  don't view it as ancient, abstract, etc.
  people are not that simple, so hst isn't simple
  a lot of ww1 docs have never seen the light of day, all sorts of gaps in the hst record, constant change in perspective.


FR rev 1789
  is still every day in your face - we just choose to ignore it here in namerica. We don't have to!
    profoundly ignorant
  when we talk about rights for people, we are in effect echoing the sentiments of the FR rev, most places in the world are still working out the consequences; words we use every day - freedom, egalitarian, rights, where do they come from?
  'these great ideas' infuse every aspect
  for our course the most important idea, the best ism here,
    NATIONALISM
      we all think we understand.
      put together it's prolly most misleading word, esp. to canadians, it's nice and passive
      every where else it is a violent proposition
      once you start defining yourself by any means or measures you automatically exclude other people
      "modern engine of history"
	almost always very powerful, difficult, cancerous idea

      nations are the most important identifiers in the world we live in
      a phenomena of 18th and 19th century, starting in rev.

      prior to this no one really dealt with the concept

      15, 16, 17th century
	live to the age of 30, it generally sucks, no concept beyond your immediate sustenance and surrounding
	"who rules this place?"
	  the landlord, maybe local aristocrat
	  have you been to this town '50km away?'
	
	only 20th century has tourism started, 90% would never go beyond 50km away
	what is identification?
	  I raise cattle, I'm gendered, I speak foo
	  a serf of the duke of orleans
	  concept of belonging to a nation state doesn't exist for most people, except the tiny minority educated, in gov't, etc.
	  
	provinces might fight together, sometimes
	
	Another great truism:
	  Revolutions occur on basic commonalities
	  basic human reactions to basic conditions
	   seek profound change, "I'm hungry"

	  revolutionARIES are intellectual and frequently evil
	    bulk are avg peasants who are pissed off
	    you don't see fat revolutionaries
	
	FR is devastated by endless wars and terrible systems of politics

	it is in the fr rev they proclaim basically most ideas of equality
    
    at first they only wanted incremental change, but it quickly gets out of control
      they first associate the king with everything that is bad
	successive waves where more people influence the course until it hits the massive in the streets (who are basically angry at everybody)

      the king himself louis xvi 'apres moi le deluge'
	once you get rid of the system, who knows what follows

    'la revolution mange ses enfants'
      revolutionaries often become the victims of the revolution itself
	read tale of two cities

      Fr aristocracy is either killed off or forced into exile
      decide to create an entire new system of religion
	'cult of the supreme being'
      destroyed the calendar
      implemented the tricolor flag of france, national anthem

    Suddenly a bunch of peasants start to identify as 'french'. unprecedented; 
      this concept starts to spread
      for the first time ever people start to identify as groups of people — people are always striving to belong to something bigger
	conscription - what a better way to get people to clump together?

    Now that they are weak, everyone else in Europe invades:
    Revolutionary Wars 1789-1793
      all aristocratic houses related
      doesn't hurt that marie antoinette was related to the leader of the austro hungarian empire
	Now they are not only killing each other, they are also being invaded by everybody

      funnily enough, the french win big — once attacked they begin to take the identity to heart.

    
    France begins to stabilize and hungry with ambition and revenge:
    Napoleonic Wars 1801-1815

      Napoleon Bonaparte
	born in corsiga
	one of the greatest figures in hst, a product of fr revol
	not terribly wealthy background
	  without the revolution he would never have made it big
	
	definitely a dictator
	also a revolutionary
	  distinguishes himself by killing rioting people

	ahead of the time, believed in universal education
	  relatively free press
	believed in new governance, new economic system

	-> fundamentally changes Europe and the nature of the revolution
	
	by 1801 he rose thru the military and supplanted the revolutionary leadership, eventually becomes supreme leader of france
	  crowns himself as emperor - revolution has ceased to exist
	    even more powerful than a kind or the pope

	  yet not simply a dictator; 
	    most fr people support him absolutely
	      stupid and apathetic
	      most people forget stuff quickly
	    believes in some of the ideals, mass participation 
	      -> you can't stop an idea whose time has come.
	
	France by this stage is stable and very powerful.

      The revolution quickly spreads to nearby areas, the french turn out to be a really good army
	soldiers start to spread the idea
	people love a winner
     
     Nationalism spread thru language, the lowest common denominator
     Language draws borders - once nationalism mrches thru the old mixed empires are done for.
      --> Linguistic nationalism is the exact antithesis of empire.

      Wherever Napoleon's armies go this concept stretches and infects
	Language is the first thing that draws people together

      As his armies march across the centre of Europe they cross the germanic states, a criss cross of districts and territories dvidied by religion. 
	But they speak basically the same language.

      1812, Napoleon sets off for Russia, uh, in June
	"Don't fuck with Russia"
	  physically speaking biggest country of the world
	  geography is certainly important
	  time honored Russian traditions:
	    suffer
	    strategically retreat
	
	it gets really wet in sept
	  whole carts of horses disappeared in mud fields
	  and then it freezes over

	5/6ths of his army disappear in Russia.
	Huge unmitigated disaster

	People now rise up against the French

    Over the course of the next five or six decades the FR Rev ideas will change central europe; almost overnight a massive empire assembles in Germany as people assemble.

    Not only just in Europe; in Japan opens up in 1868 based on American diplomacy and now begins to think in terms of empire and nation
    1867 in Canada; 1861-65 US becomes a unified country

    Basically every country in the 19th century undergoes a nationalist change — *everything* changes

    The problem then becomes everyone who aspires to nationhood but then don't achieve it.


    Most of the time most people identify peacfully; unfortunate a lot of the time the moment you start identifying you exclude a lot of other people, which takes on militant proportions and extreme nationalism. 
      gotta get rid of the other people

    
    Napoleon's system collapses, until he comes back, escapes from prison, rebuilds another army and in june 1815 he has one last great battle in Waterloo, Belgium
    

    How do we undo this spectre of ideas?
    The great powers of Europe come together (Austria, Ottoman, UK, Russians, Prussia) and dictate a peace to France in the Congress of Vienna, the first of its kind.
      How do we now create a world in the absence of Napoleon?

      --> The Concert of Europe/Congress of Vienna system (historical term)
	notion of running the show in a beautiful congress
	two determinations
	  1. Make sure nationalism is CRUSHED
	    exact opposite of empire
	    whether by force or coersion, make sure nationalist id don't exist (some take it literally and kill them)
	    every empire tries this, keep the balance of power.
	  2. Make sure another dictator like Napoleon never manages to come into power
	    That's how they were to act in 'concert'

	  --> implicitly, you create alliances so we can come together and make sure everybody knows their place
	  unfortunately, the world does not work that way



  Ottoman Empire
    stretches from the cusp of Europe, the balkans to north africa
    all sorts of ethnicities and cultures

1754-1856 crimean

1866 austro prussian war
1866-68 danish wars
1870-71 franco prussian war
alsace, lorraine

'pressures for war'
  exert tremendous negative influence on the balance of power (empires)
  tracing the collapse of the intl order as we know it post 1815
  concert of europe system couldn't predict the future
    the principles are very loose
    nationalism is antithetical to empire

  no one was stupid enough to say 'there will be no more wars'
  what they were trying to do was limit the conflicts so that none of the great powers fought them or fought them in tandem

  Powers:
  Acting in unison, intermarried for centuries. Not ideologically different.
  Sense of tragedy and heaviness at heart - going to war against family members, with like minded people. Lots in common

    britain - rules the waves, sun never sets
    france
    austrian empire/austro-hungarian
    russia
    ottoman empire
      most culturally distracted, but not another world
      tended to be seen as quite different, but they're not totally foreign
    the german states, soon to become germany

    All fundamentally in agreement that they don't want a big war where everyone lines up against each other.
    ww1 was no surprise - a war is very likely to happen, inevitable
    tragic in that everyone was aware of these pressures

  Def of empire/power in 19th century - colonies and navies.

Big war
  --> Crimea: 1854-1856
    Southernmost tip of Russia, always biggest country in the world
    A certain tragedy to being Russia, it is surrounded by cold, useless ocean	grossly limited in navy
    The black sea on the other hand is sadly totally surrounded by the ottoman empire, who control these two bottlenecks.

    This yields a natural desire to fuck up the ottomans; the straits are tiny and easy to defend

    How do the UK and FR respond?
      Well shit, I guess we should side with Ottoman, can't let the ruskis get too big.
      Balance of power?
	The other powers don't show up.
	They send 'limited' armies that don't fight very well (this part unintended)

    War ends as a tie - but the Russian empire ends up denied access to the straits. Balance of power is maintained. The ydon't want anyone to lose really badly.

    Only accomplishment (russians never forget)
      srsly offended, harbour uk and fr resentment.

  #####
  --> US civil war 1861-1865
    Wasn't rly over slavery but the concept of states' rights.
    How an indiv state in the union views itself relative to the fed gov't
    War b/w Union (N) and the Confederacy (S).
      
    What does it have to do with intl order?
      UK very nearly found itself drawn to the war, to intervene on the side of the confederacy over cotton production
      Massively important for their textile industry, fuel for the industrial revolution, trade.
      Where is cotton also grown in Egypt and India, the other major cotton producers. Control of cotton represents an econ monopoly and essential for empire.

    At the eocivil war it becomes a true country. US has massive resources, once it spans the continent.

    American potential begins here.
    Surrounded by a giant moat and lacking natural enemies.

    Begins to change balance of power.

  #####
  --> 1866 Austro-Prussian War, 1866-68 Danish war
    Problem's abrewin'

    Nationalism running its course, the Danes and the Germans start to itch for independence.

    In Prussia, you start to have a real desire for a German confederation, nationhood. Prussian initiate the German states start to drawn upon themselves.

    Austria is all like fuuuuck thaaaat, but they fail.
      Other nationalities start to do the same. 
      Hungarians agitate, Austrians make a deal:
	We'll call ourselves the Austro-Hungarian, stick around and we'll give you an army and all that, dual monarchy

    Austrian Empire is desperate to maintain itself.

    How do the other powers respond to this?
      Other powers might supply some of the sides, but they do not get involved.

      Ethno linguistic map of the balkans, Hungarian has nothing to do with all the other langs in the region.
      Everyone else are Slavs. Fuck ton of minor ethnicities, but related to Russia; local crisis between these peeps, the Russians see them as cousins and are interested in bringing them into their empire. 
      Serbs are all like, Russia our buddies!

      Austria left to also fight all these Slavs. They are kind of fucked.

    --> In the 19th century we refer to the ottoman empire and the austro-hungarian empire as 'the sick men of europe'.
      Dying from within from the cancer of nationalism. Most acute in these countries. They collide in the same place (S. Europe)


  ####
  --> Franco-Prussian 1870-1871
    The one that challenges the intl order the most
    Leads to creation of Germany

    In terms of a people, DE is a very old place. Most philosophers, classical musicians, culture is old.

    German states divided by religion, lang dialects. Nationalist desire swells up, driven by intellectuals and leaders.

    1850s-1870s Prussia starts to get other peeps to join in to the idea of German unification. 
    Some remain with the Austrians but the momentum becomes very great.

    Post 1866 Prussia feels like it can use force other peeps to join.

    French do not like this.
      Balance of power gets fucked up.
      Mishmash of small states > giant german power
      Nobody exactly thrilled by this.

    Alsace and Lorraine
      The peeps in there are both FR and DE speakers. 
      Prussians want them in the confed, FR says le no

      No one else gets involved, disrupt balance of power.
      Fr seemed to poised to crush them

    Surprisingly, they totally fuck up the French brutally.
      Unification becomes a fait acompli.

    German army marches all the way to Versailles and proclaim unification.
    Immediately become massive power, becomes #1 industrial power.
      This rubs the Fr the wrong way.

    Balance of power totally fucked up.


Germany as a great power
  Would like to have a massive navy, colonies, immediately tweaks the British in the wrong way
    No colonies left aside from chunks of Africa.
    By late 19th century, race for Africa the last unspoiled part of the world.
    1885-1914 completely changes face of Africa

    Germans get Tanzania, kind of shitty. The German Cameroons, SouthWest Africa/Namibia - all desert. Brits have Egypt, and then the Suez canal. South Africa, which is fabolously rich, Nigeria and the Gold Coast (Ghana).
      Germans are so desperate they take anything free. One of the Hawaian islands. Little city states in China.

  What does this leave? You can take things by force.

  If you're France and Russia, you're scared. Giant power who does not like you. They ally each other as a safeguard - but this comes at a price.


  The British on the other hand... eh they are related. They don't *hate* each other. They definitely don't like the French nor the Russians. Their royal families are related. Natural allies.


Once more: overwhelming tragedy is that ww1 is a war that never should've happened. About 50% of the Germans on one side spoke great English. 

Unifcation of Germany: problematic. 
But nothing compared to the crisis in the Balkans.
  For 40 years prior ot ww1 everyone coulda told you that a war was coming.
  The Powder Keg of Europe

  --> 1878
    Serbia, one of the most militant of the Slavic nations, wanted nationhood. Start to demand more and more of the Aus-Hun empire; they can't submit or else they will cease to exist. Give into Serbia and everyone else will want in.
    They start to give certain powers like taxation and its own police force. The real trouble becomes when the Serbs start talking about the adjacent territories filled with Serb nationalists. Very nearly leads to war.

    Aus-Hun is prepared to fuck up the Serbs and make them an example.
      But! The Russians might have a problem with this and the Germans will find ways to make their influence felt.

    Good news: No war. Bad news: Gets postponed to 1914.
    The Russians back down, withdraw - the Tsar is forced to back down by the Germans who hint that they will flex a muscle, 'Never again, by god. never again' - Never again back down.  

    By 1878 all the ingredients for war are present.

###
Int'l pressures for war:
  1899-1901 Boer War
    Brits finds itself fighting a guerrila insurgency against dutch and german farmers aiming to create an independent homeland
    Brits squash them; takes them two years.

    Their empire goes to war; Canadians went to fight. 
    Germans secretely help the Boers.

  1898-1900 Spanish American War
    Spain has descended into chaos, and the US ostensibly goes to war over Cuba to 'protect it'. Within a few weeks US inherits a global empire, getting Dom Rep, Puerto Rico, the Phillipines. 

    Balance of power becomes totally different, new world order.

  1900 Boxer Rebellion
    Lots of Chinese nationalists (read: anti western) upset over the steep decay of its old empire. Get crushed.

    'Fists of Harmonious Righteousness' -> Boxers

    China became a buffet for westerners to pick over.

  Balance becomes too fragmented for the Concert to keep working.
  Change is seldom peaceable, it's terrifying. Most nations completely freak out at the pace of change.

  Not only do they have to deal with this, they now have to face ideology and epidemics.


####sept 23

Nationalism - ugly, brutal, most conflicts, not patriotism
19th century phenomena - no such thing as nation states prior.

Throughout 19th century gets lucky - the balance of power remains unchllenged.

Imperial nationalism starts to spread.
The balance of power est. after 1815 starts to crumble.

Italian unification in 1860-1868 comes across. Coming together of states into 'Italy', the concept of which didn't really exist prior.
Similarly, German unification - old culture, old history, new state.
Can even talk about US eocivil war, or even Canada's confederation (unimportant tho).

Japan - an old old place, the oldest dynasty in history, it's not *created* in 19th century, but then it becomes a country in the modern sense. 
  1868 japan 'opens up' to the western world. 
  Genie out of the bottle syndrome

Various pressures - econ competition, imperial competition, nationalism
--> Alliances (are complicated) come in different shapes and forms
  Loose and binding alliances
  At their ultimate extent are binding agreements
      Nations don't really care about binding agreements? Mostly true, but there are srs consequences for not following thru on alliances
      What are these consequences? 
      Loss of credibility leading to immediate diplomatic isolation, which is almost as dangerous as going to war

  These powers are abundantly the same, no ideological conflict, up to this stage alliances are impermanent when you don't believe in much. 
  All of them understand the dangers of alliances
  
Hit list of the great powers:
Roughly speaking, all europeans
  UK
    At the time most important, Britannia owns the waves, best in the world
    At the sea almost undefeatable, also controls all the choice colonies
    Nobody in 1815 during the concert of europe ever wanted a power supreme;
    UK is not a dictatorship, they do not want to control the whole world
    They want to be a preeminent power but a lot of it was accumulative, no actual you know planning, no anticipation
    By 1900 you have one power that is much larger than the others
    Most political stable for several hundred years, parliamentary democracy, have had their civil wars they were long before other nations. Encourages econ growth, which enables them to control industrial revolution and build ships and go out and conquer.
    by 1890 uk controls 50% of ALL global trade goes thru London, 50% of all finance comes out of London. No one else has ever achieved that much predominance


  DE
    The Germanic states unifying in 1861, the diplomatic equiv of an atom bomb.
    Huge effect on global affairs, strategically located.
    FR and Russ hugely worried
    When it unifies it becomes the \#1 producer of iron ore and coal in the world
    Might seem like bad news which UK dislikes - but its a resource rich econ without an industrial infrastructure (which they can buy from UK)
    Very fast studies, stereotypical ruthless efficiency
    In 30 yrs its economy expands threefold. 
    Both DE and UK dislike the French, they're pretty similar, royal families are related
    Best educated system, more Germans are literate than anyone else 
      Which makes a much greater army

    Old history leads to a really deep sense of intellectually founded nationalism


  FR
    Also profoundly arrogant
    Terribly concerned with this new germany business, Humiliated by them

    Going through this immense industrial growth, but its empire is second fiddle at best and its in far flung places
    Rehabilitated itself considerably from Napoleon - the UK find them less disagreeable by late 19th century.
    Something really unusual is happening: as you get wealthier and more educated the opportunity of having large families drops dramatically; poverty leads to more kids.
      France can no longer field such an army; Germans on the other hand have programs to increase fertility.
      By 1890s Germany has surpassed them in population and industry
    

  Aus-Hun
    Ethnic nightmare; the sick men of europe
    Economically developed state; not some backwater
    The problem is that its econ industrialism is uneven. Austria is doing great but large tracts really are backwards.

    Lost German & Italian states, filled with wars from within

  Ottoman Empire
    Also very much an economic power house, also fucked by nationalism
    Got so many different ethnicities it doesn't even make sense


  Russ
    The most curious and problematic
    Geographically the largest. Just fucking huge.
    Doesnt have overseas coloniesb ut its an empire; roughly 50% of the pop is not russian. 
    It's army is massive, but its the most cuorrupt and complicated, least econ viable and therefore the least capable of fighting a modern war.




  If you're the British, you view the spectre of war with caution
  What they are most concerned about is anything that would force them to go to war when they don't want to.
  Alliances screw this up; likely to get stuck doing something it has no interest in.

  The richer and more powerful UK gets the more anxious it gets to stay away from the continent. By late 19th century UK diplomacy is governed by concept of 'splendid isolation'. Not to be confused with isolationism.
  Literally mentions this in a speech, talking about entanglements with Europe. It's good to be isolated from the Continent.

  With UK out of the equation, the other more or less equal powers balance each other out.
  

  So you're another power and you want more - what do you do? You emulate #1
  --> Germany starts a massive shipbuilding program.
    British goes waaaait a second there.
    Britain decides to leave its splendid isolation and join an alliance.
    Britain is a huge question mark until July 1914.

ww1: most important event in history

Thinks about the shifts that have happened way beyond just the mil and political consequences. Women become economically empowered, political leverage goes up

Name a facet of life and ww1 has a tangible effect on it.

Italy was never a great power yet during the course of the war and after it will gain this status.

Italy by virtue of being a new country goes thru some really really dramatic ideological shifts during the course of ww1, it's in the two new countries and japan where the old empire becomes a new country that starts to breed ideological extremism.

Real no ideological diff in Empire;

Balance of power:
  US' existence fundamentally changes it
    massive, not interested in imperialism
    if we went to war in europe, how would we view the US as the land of milk and honey
    what is the US gonna do? which shifts european game

  Same as Japan
    Not white nor european. 
    Brings to the table a distinctly different view of the world
    Sent their kids to school in Europe, fluent in FR,, EN, DE
    Think like westerners in many respects, but they are *not* westerners

  Representative of this, Serbia
    Example of how nationalism from within, this cancer, becomes a fundamental geopolitical problem (instead of just intellectual).
    Works in fairly predictable fashion

    Painful exercise

    Nationalism is everything, inclusivity who you are and who you are not
    Prime example of how militant nationalism becomes a real physical problem for Europe. Aus-Hun cannot manage Serbia; to give into them would be giving away the Slavs, which is a large part of the Empire. 

    Serbias nationalism represents a 'pan slavism'
    They do try hard to accede to their demands, the serbians really got their act together and got good at defining the concept of nationhood. 

    --> Identities are constructed, very fluid.

    Serbs are masters at inventing a history. A group of elites will create an identity, a sense of belonging and convince people. 

    Unfortunately, they've also claimed land that is inhabited by people who do not necessarily identify as serbians.

    Ethnic identities are literally made up. 

    In addition to all these imperial struggles, we now have to deal with this very agressive entity named Serbia.

    Serbia has a thirst for autonomy, which gets acceded to. Aus-Hun cannot give it total indepence without destroying the empire.

    How do they become so unified? System of education, fairy tales. Very powerful, caustic nationalism. Most famous is the group called the Black Hand. 	Good news: not representative of all of Serbia
	Bad news: terrorists, they want to disrupt Aus Hun, operate in high circles of the Serb government. 
	If you study some of their opinions, they talked about 'exclusionary nationalism' from the very start (i.e. ethnic cleansing). 

    Very aggressive claims of territory as in Bosnia, which the Serbians want for their own nation. Only an example of many other places of the world.


Balkans wars: 1878, 1911-1913
  first one, russians backed down

  There are three separate wars in the Balkans, all small, all involving the Balkan players themselves. Everybody fights everybody, fucked up, complicated.



---> Finally, more isms. Later 19th century phenomena
Like FR Revolution, Industr. Revol spawns new ways of thinking about hte world

  Socialism/Marxism
    Gonna meet directly at eoww1, goes from concept to physical reality when Russia falls in 1917.
    Began in 19th century, a product of the industrial revolution.
    Karl Marx, a german born jew, writes about class warfare, in the midst of the industrial revolution in England in exile (cos he's a shit disturber).Challenges the balance of power. 
    
    All these empires: remarkably similar, aren't many distrinctions between them. No one had a particular ideology, until these theories of human history start to come about.


  Social Darwinism
    Evolutionary biology, 'survival of the fittest', some plants and animals are just better at surviving along. Just better equipped than others.

    People extrapolate from this and came up with a persuasive yet terribly cynical justfication for colonialism
      cos they *should*, they're better equipped to run the world

    Mixed in with religion, all empires validate themselves with this righteousness. 'white mans burden', our burden to go out and civilize peeps, white peeps are just better
    It also justifies wars between Empires.

    The concept becomes prevalent amongst all of the top elites. 


  Militarism
    Think you might understand the def thru the etymology, like with ntinlism, but not quite.

    A love of military, to further it, sure.
    Also implies that there is an economic system designed to support the propagation of ones armed forces, actually implies an economic control system - a managed economy, as the pressures of war mount they will increasingly intervene in their economies to drive them to war.

    An effort to manage these giant imperial economies and prepare them for war; not just liking one's army.

    In late 19th century, we need to understand the minutia. You could have the world's largest army (like RUSS) or all sorts of resources and still be absolutely be unprepares for war. The reason is the minutia - on paper it's a huge empire. In reality it does not have enough shoes or food for its army. Largely illiterate. Mass bits of the army will starve to death.

    Need to make sure you have all the adequate logistics; directed economy is required. 

    --> This leads us to an 'arms race'.
      Prevalent from the dawn of time, just a human tendency. 
      Very specific: the Navy.

      Ships generally designed to do different things. Between a cruiser a destroyer, the HMS dreadnought (exam question) created in 1906 and it comes after decades of british naval construction (best in the world) and british naval strategy. Not overnight; constant need to upgrade the Navy. 

      British id their empire with their Navy. Constantly looking to upgrade their massive Navy infrastrucutre.
      The new ingredient is the industrial revolution, which has introduced all sorts of new naval technology. 
      At the beginning of the century, old woodden ships and sails
      By the end of the 19th century you were dead in those, Almost every mil vessel had a metal hull with big cannons.

      The learning curve is very steep; British sought to build a 'superweapon'

      Dreadnaught totally revolutionises tactical deployment. Has 4 big turbine engines, the fastest ship in the world. All weather vehicle, in all waters in the world at any time in the world. Can break thru ice tho it usually doesn't. 12 inches of steel armour. When it rolls off a dry dock, they actually shoot cannons against it and it just bounces off. Almost impenetrable to every other ship in the world.

      It has 5 rotating turrets. Gun emplacements, in the old days you would have to turn your vessel, which is no longer an issue. Fired 1 pound shells that can be fired 10k yards. For the first time in Hst you will not see the ship shooting upon you (totally changes shit up).

      When it rolls out of dry dock, it renders two thirds of the world's navies obsolete. Everyone wants one themselves. It goes from being a single ship to a whole class shortly. 
      
      --> A naval race begins 1906-1914. All the powers that can desperately want to build one. 

      Immediately, everyone has to step up each other's games. 
      This fucks with people, starts a naval scare.
      The reality of the race is separate; the scare is that we are convinced we are building many many more than we actually are. This fuels the fires of resentment, hostility much more than the actual race.

      The culprit behind this? Education. One of the 19th century phenoms is univ. education, most people squander their literacy. Tabloids, propaganda. Literally crap, propagate misinformation. Vast majority start to believe the fairy tales of how many are being built

      In 1908 after a German navy law, 500 thousand people descend on UK parliament chanting 'we want 8 and we wont wait'.
      Dudes like William Le Queux writes fantastical stories about german spies

      Enormous ingredient on the road to war. 


German Naval Laws
  1900
    pre-dreadnaught
    old place, new country - feels pressure for imp. glory more than most
    Places accelerated naval construction; FR and UK have had longstanding avies
    Germans have to create one from scratch

  1908
    with dreadnaught in mind
    Particularly dramatic

Premised on the Kaiser Willhem II (1888-1918)
      Do not think of him like Adolf; a lot of what he thinks might resonate, but totally different backgrounds.
      Sees germany as a great power and wants it to be a greater power.
      Very agressive world view; sees that DE should expand upon its power
	'Germany wants its place in the sun', take on British 'sun never sets in the empire'

      Does not necessarily want Britain's place; the French on the other hand...
      Has an idea of the world,
      --> weltpolitik
	world politic, germany wants power, conflict is inherent
	fundamental threat to the balance of power.


  German democracy ultimately controlled by land owning elites, friends of the King, has much more power on parliament (Bundestag) than the British King.
  Kaiser dictates this militaristic approach/economy. He makes it mandatory that Naval strategy become requisite in all university courses. A disciple of Mahan, naval strategist who mantains that empires are born of navies (predicts carriers), whose book becomes mandatory reading in German universities. 
  His embrace of the Navy is inherently against the balance of power. Generally not thinking about the consequences of his politics.

  The first thing he does when he comes into power is to dismiss Otto Von Bismarck.
    Bismarck: one of the most famous generals in history, renowned as a realist in foreign policy. Spearheaded German unification, and after that brought Germany into the balance of power. Tho very militaristic and conservative, he maintained balance of power thru very artful diplomacy. He understands that war is shitty, and tried to keep Germany out of wars. When he dismissed, the Kaiser is being really arrogant.


  Kaiser's first cousins:
  first born grandson of queen victoria
    Czar Nicholas II (1894-1917)
    king Edward VII (1901-1910)
    king George V (1910-1936)

    Why would the germans go to war with the UK? They're so similar.


Alliances:
  The last ingredient needed for war
  Most spectacular, most confusing

  Congress of Vienna
    keep nationl'sm under wraps
    make sure not one power dominates the continent
    = balance of power.
      Can only work while everyone is relatively equitable


  Once alliances start things become more rigid, almost impossible to maintian a balance. 

  As nationalism becomes more unmanageable, peeps have to take action and provoke reactions from outside your empire, and so you need an alliance. Once that starts other people will want to one-up you.

  Alliance system:
    Starts with the 'dual alliance' 1879. 
    Followed by the triple alliance 1881
      one alliance system
      Germany + Aus-Hun and then Italy.

      Central powers allied in a permanent alliance
      This alliance (IT is not a great power, tho geographically important)
	Small footnote: Italy joins with one proviso, it will go to war but only if one of those two is attacked. If it does the attacking, it can stay neutral.
      Not every alliance is the same. Binding documents that outline exactly what you have to do.

      the Alliance powers.
      As we get closer to war they wil lreach out and try to get the ottomans in with them - they all are concerned with Russia.

    Profound consequences for breaking a treaty
      You are now alone, no one will trust you anymore. 

    Scramble for alliances begins.

    Reinsurance treaty, 1890
      Kaiser makes a big decision. Decides to end the reinsurance treaty, allows it to lapse. Created by Bismarck to assure Russia, that they would not fuck with them. In part a response to the Balkans war.

      Message is kind of obvious.
      Wilhelm expected/wanted a war. Catch is that he expected one with France and Russia, but not with England.
      Concept of war mostly like a game of risk.

      What do you do if you're Russia?

    Can't sign with the Turks... hey the French.

    Franco-Russian Entente 1894. 
      Desperate, and form a desperate alliance across this central european juggernaught. 
      Fought against each other with Napoleon and Crimea.
      Fundamentally a reaction to the Alliance.


    What about Britain?
      Wants splendid isolation. Does not see *any* alliance as being productive.
      Wants to stay out of european affairs. 
      They know full well that the moment they enter an alliance system it will fuck things up. 
      German structure is way more powerful; good news tho, we like each other! You would assume they would favour that alliance.
      However they now are a major threat to the british and their imperial security. Courtesy of the naval scare, start to take a much dimmer view of their german cousins than they should have.

      Now the brits look to their two worst enemies as potential alliance partners. British rethink their concept of empire.

      Out of all of our imperial positions which ones are the most threatened, and work back from that position. Let's rejig the empire to enable us to fight a war in Europe; enable defacto independence for Canada, Australia. 

      In Asia, only major threat are the Japanese; if they become our friends we can pull mil resources from the area. Britain enters the system indirectly.

      Anglo-Japanese Naval accord in 1902
	Signed every 10 years, with Russia in mind.
	in 1912, the threat is Germany.
	in 1922 it changes again.

	the moment the british line up against Russia, they freak out.

	For Japan it's enourmously symbolic. Invited to the big kids table, there are people weeping in the streets of Tokyo. Worlds preminent power asks them to join this large family of powers.

	However, what if they are not so restrained?
	Once britain joins the game things change.

      Anglo-French Entente 1904
      Anglo-Russian Entent 1907
	Diff kinds of relationships - 'entent' -> understandings
	Not formally binding to the UK.

	Unfortunately, the Germans interpret these as alliances and tension in Europe shoots up.



#Sept30

Old concept that this was all caused from the aggressive fp of germany; eh onot quite
"new spin", now most historians argue that there's a twist:
  Britain bears a small amount of responsibility
  'how much responsibility does Britain bear?'

  Is this accidental that UK's policy is ambiguous or is there a more sinister design behind it?

  Britain's Entente's

  UK make a point of it being an entent rather than an alliance, with the presumption that they can maintain a free hand
  
  --> Arguments
    Some people think they did it this way cos they didn't know how to maintain the balance of power; trying to keep a free hand.
    
    UK entered into these ententes with the express purpose to send vague messages to all alliance members; allowing the UK to sit on the fence and join whichever side it wanted to


Mixed signals were sent.

The germans become more and more convinced that the british and their would-be allies are trying to encircle Germany, which in turn incentivizes them to gain more power

Dreadnaught built between French entente and Russian entente and the german naval law is after.

The Germans begin to perceive UK FP as encirclement whether it's true or not



Moar crises post 1894 all of these come back to the alliance system:

  Sino-Jap war 1894-1895
    China is huge but absolutely in decline
    Penetrated by every single colonial power
    Nobody 'owns' china, but they've penetrated the chinese coast and created city states. Most big cities are international cities or dominated by one or two foreigners.
    Jap is in ascendancy and they want ch resources.

    The rest of the world looks at Japan, and the UK are like welll why not.
    Other powers start to get nervours; Russia esp.

  Egypt 1898
    Britain and France nearly go to war yet again
    Don't actually fight.

  US-Spanish 1898-1900
    Disruption of global power; accidentally become an empire overnight
    Arguments over whether they intended to

    Spain is on its knees, ostensibly over Cuba
    US decides to posture as the defender of the Cubans.
    Chase them across the ocean, quick war

    Rise of the US as an actual power; Britain starts to look towards the US, anticipating they might have to call upon them. (trading away canadian claims to alaska)
  
  Boxer Rebellion 1900
    Pissed off chinese nationalists
    Foreign troops from all over the world show up and put them down
    In Beijing it's literally an international team.
  
  Boer war 1899-1901
    S.African boers decide to rise up against the british commonwealth
    German clandestinely provides supplies (start to help peeps that piss the brits off)

  Russo-Jap 1904-1905
    How the alliance system works:
    Britain has signed a treaty in 1902 with Japan, the first entering into the alliance system.

    Reason for this is geography: when there is a void other peeps tend to collide, making jp and ru enemies.

    Railways across russia to control empire, and cut across to the pacific into the sea of Japan, way close to ch territory, Machuria.

    As China decays, the Japs gain territory in Manchuria and begin building railways. They literally collide, become immediate rivals.

    Russia is also a pacific power, which would annoy you if you're Japanese. They move their fleet to Port Arthur, to posture against the Japs.

    Russians profoundly arrogant, thinking that their massive armies are sufficient. Japan sees this as an opportunity to rise in the world by taking on Russia. Due to its massive size, the Russians take a while to move their troops, and the Japanese sneak attack and sink their entire fleet at Port Arthur.

    Russians are fucked. Their Baltic fleet is fucking crazy far away, and they have to go thru all these British owned straits.

    They could ask or pay fees, but the Brits got that treaty. Puts the British in an awkward spot. 

    Several months into the war they show up into Asia Pacific and come across the japanese sea. The Japanese are placed in the Tsushima Strait separating Korea and Japanese. The Japanese ambush the fleet and destroy it yet again. 

    Russians fight to a draw on the land war, ceases to be a pacific power and is totally exhausted by this war. 
    Japanese defeats a european power, rises to the global stage.

    The land war on the other hand is a perfect demonstration of the horros of ww1 to come; same technology, same kind of horrors - but no one is really paying attention


    The British are unsettled by this. The balance of power is shifted, leaving only Japan and the British in the area. They are unchecked and can effectively do whatever they want.

  Morocco 1906-06, 1911
    2 separate crisis almost identical.
    Under french rule; parts of morocco want to be independent
    The Sharif of Fez turns to other imperial powers, in this case Germany who wants to fuck shit up and send a large fleet.

    The French ask the Brits for help and leave them in a quandary.
      How do they show the French they are serious and the Germans that they aren't?
      They send a fleet and all three fleets just sit there and chill until they negotiate it out.

      A mixed message; from a fr perspective it's great! for the germans, well they showed up but at the same time they didn't fight. Eh!

  Balkan wars 1911-1913
    Involves russia, austria and the turks.
    'young turk' Revolution in 1908 in Ottoman empire that replaces the sultan with mil officers; several republics like Bulgaria break away.
    Seeing them as weak, everyone begins to attack the Turks and starts using this 

    Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece vs Ottoman

    Final question goes down to Bosnia-Herzegovina:
      Austria has had enough, and will not back down to Serbia's demands. Alliance system kicks in like dominoes and the question becomes:
      What will britain do?


#oct5

thinking of battles in 19th century terms without thiking about 20thcentury technology

causes of war comes to roost in one particular placein 1914, not to say that this war would not have ocurred some place else - war is inevitble by this point. No surprise here, just where and when?

Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia Herzegovina
Heavily contested by all powers directly and indirectly

Blame on everyone:
  Serbs
    in addition to being troublesome in the empire
    use their nationalism not to just gain autonomy but also claiming other parts as part of a greater serbia
    due to this jockeying it gains a kind of autonomy
    very militant serbs subscribing to terrorist orgs like the 'Black Hand'
    they use Sarajevo as their claim of a greater Serbia
    --> Austrians hoever also want Sarajevo as a symbol of their cohesion

  Archduke Franz Ferdinand travels to Sarajevo; of all of the officials in the Aus empire, he was prolly most sympathetic. Sent on a goodwill tour, but unappreciative of how controlled Sarajevo was by Serbians and how deep the animosity against him went.
    Not that he never thought they would try to kill him, he makes all sorts of unfortunate decisions
    Sec detail is much smaller than it should be - trying to signal that he is unafraid
    Disregards their advice and publishes most of the details of when or where he's going to appear. Wanted everybody to show up
    Decides to show up in an open vehicle, a convertible
    on the day he's assassinated, a bomb goes off in his hotel and instead of getting the fuck out, he shows himself out and continues on his path

    As he's rounding in traffic, out of the shadows an assassin named Pricipe and kills both him as his wife as the bullet ricochets.
      Perfect harbinger of doom, [mythical creature that gives you an advance warning].
      google archduke assassination

    Is a perfect catalyst of what is to come, a causus belli

  Austria
  -------
    uses this an excuse to go to war
    
    approaches in 2 styles
      1) list of ultimatums to the serbian gov't, which are progressively more difficult to meet - very hard for them to meet. Rig it so they cant really meet all of their demands
      2) Smart to realize that a war just between them and serbia is impossible, they go see their friends in Berlin

      Within a week of the assassination, they ask the germans for support as per their 1878 alliance.

  Germany
  -------
    If you have a sober friend who is thinking seriously, he would tell you not to get into a fight; germany is itching for a fight
    --> Instead of advising them to cool off, they give them a 'blank cheque' on July 5, 1914 saying that they will sponsor and support Austria in any circumstances. Kaiser doesn't even consult parliament.

    Austrians now much more confident over the prospects of war.

Mobilisation
  today when nations mobilize they press a button and you're good to go
  in 1914, it is used as a defacto decl of war; it requires a lot of infrastructure
  it signals to everyone else what your intentions are
  predicated on how sophisticated your mil and economy are
  In the most sophisticated places, it can be 'partial', respinding in kind to the nature of your threat. Send some of its army, some of its navy, the economy functions normally. You can do it if you have a standing army.

  up until this point, your pro army was more than suitable for all of these fights

  with all these prospects, you need to go into a full mobilistion
  if yr russia you have a 1mil standing army, the biggest one
    this means you need all the food, the bullets, the hay, the etc
    if you intent to go to war you're going to need to mobilize five million men and get all the extra food, bullets, etc
    most are illiterate, so you even have to tell your peasants that war is going on

    when germany goes from partial to full mobi, it takes about 3-5 weeks as most of the people are literate and partially trained
    if you're russia, it can take months to mobilize everyone

  Much more than some little trivial issue, how functional is your economy, and competent your gov't is

  if yr the french and see the DE mobilize part of their army, eh they're not necessarily goign to attack you. If they mobilize 3 million people, you get concerned and mobilize as well. important in diplmacy

  Russians
  --------

    Now in 1914, fearing russian reputation is in the line
    the russkis turn around and give the Aus a list of ultimatums to rescind their ultimatums

    However htey don't have the ability to partially mobilize, so they have no choice but to fully mobilize. Comes with a tragic bend.
    Nicky's diary is all "took a warm bath in the ocea" when he mobilizes 5 million dudes.

    With Russia fully mobilizing, Germany and Aus have no choice but to fully mobilize as well.

    France mobilizes as well.


    When you fully mobilize, your retool your economy towards war, and their food supply is weakened.


--> Big question is: what is the UK going to do?
  Germans convinced that Britain has no cause to fight almost right to the end
  Why would they want to fight us over? We are innately allies. 
    Both hate fr and ru
    econ compatible
    similar lang and culture

  Germans want a war, and they're cool with doing it with FR and RU at the same time.


  British
  ------

    Here is where their culpability comes in.
    What is in it for the Brits to send mixed signals until August 1914?
      They're down with having everyone else fuck up while they stay out

    German planned for this war a decade before this war occurs
      ---> planned this mobilisation with the Schlieffen Plan of 1905
      German objective to avoid fighting in two fronts, ideally fight one at one time
      Based on everything within the country, the Germans look at Russia and go, you will mobilise the slowest. Takes weeks to cross the country, give them at least 2 months to mobilize their standing army. You strike France first.

      Focus armies on the western front, leaving only a basic army in the east. Unlikely to be attacked as it lacks offensive capabilities.

      Being German they are ruthlessly efficient and think of all sorts of eventualities. The FR expect them to attack at Alsace and Lorraine.
      Therefor they decide to attack them from Belgium, which is also much loser to Paris. The Schlieffen plan expects them to sweep up from behind.

      ---> One problem: it's guaranteed by treaty to be neutral.
      Have not accounted for the diplomatic fallout
	
      Principle of neutrality is at stake, but more importantly if they win they totally fuck up the balance of power. 

      The British position was totally underestimated, and this is where it begins to change.

    The Germans understand it will incense the Brits when they invade Belgium. Very last moment, Belgium is issued an ultimatum to attack the French.
    British issue a counter ultimatum, which the Germans are OK with.
      The British don't have the capacity to fight, don't really want to fight over FRaaaance and Beeeelgium, it will be awkward over, is ok.

      Brilliance and tragedy of it: when the Brits go to war, the Empire goes to war. Brit army isn't very big, but their empire is. France's empire goes to war. South east asia goes to war.

      By the end of August 1914 there are fifteen million men from all over the world.

##############

ww1/ww2 one war separated by a twenty year peace

how much our world is a product of ww1
obv. diplomacy's gonna change

generational effect - twenty years later many leaders had been involved
women's lib, increased social and econ freedom

technology dramatically changes
corporations fight the war - ford, gm, mitsubishi

appreciate the physicality of the war, the terrible tragedy of this
a generation of men with very few ideological differences

basic physical stuff:
  ultimately a war of attrition
  no one is used to this kind of warfare
  the front lines barely change over 4 years

  other front lines:
    the alps
    eastern front, quite fluid
    balkan front

    and war at sea

  western front:
    only about 200km long.
    cos its flat and full of rivers, the shelling turned the whole thing in to a mudfield
    rampant disease - malaria in turkish front, typhoid, dysentery, The Flu

    The Spanish Flu was a product of world war I, kills 60 mil people

In 1914, as the men march off expecting to come on home by december, germans load a gun named 'Big Bertha' which required 36 horses and 200 men to mobilize weighing 33 tons, shooting 2000 shells in one round for a min range of 10 miles. It shelles Paris from 60km away. 19th century war in terms of tactics and strategy.

By eo1914 over 2 million refugees in Belgium. 5k belgiums killed under the pretext of being guerrillas. Cdn soldiers responding to a rumour that germans are crucifying captured soldiers, begin to crucify german soldiers.

Ridiculousness of war: at Verdun, within 72hrs about 80,000 dead on both sides. In the Somme in 1915 there are 250,000 men died over 2weeks. 


Gallipolli 1915-1916

Still 12 million unexploded shells in western front
Since 1991, 66 farmers have died in Belgium as their mchinery hits shells
Tons of campers and lumberjacks, forensic historians.

Since eoww2 700 bomb specialists died trying to disarm ww1 bombs.
Rifles have totally changed, albeit initially a lot sucked for rain and mud.

last months of 1914 were inundanted with heavy rain fall, leading to gun jams. You had machine guns, which was new, hand grenades, mines.

Mustard gas! Formerly known as chlorine gas, devised for the war, most feared thing of all in the war - it would hover in trenches.

Aeroplanes make their appearance in ww1, submarines, tanks, barbed wire. most gfx example of all - xmas 1914 along the western front spontaneously a german baker on the german lines started singing silent night and the brits started to sing and a couple of them went into no man's land and they started to exchange pictures, they brought out food rations and had xmas dinner together in many places of the western front.
