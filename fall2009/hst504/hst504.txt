signups for seminar - two hr block on monday

first for all hst never starts when we say it starts
dates are kind of arbitrary

hst truisms
  exact dates are unimportant
  about themes and ideas, ideas drive history
  pick major intellectual events to launch a course
  don't think of hst as little components; a sort of river in to which all sorts of diff things flow and drive it forward
  n. americans are ahistorical
  don't view it as ancient, abstract, etc.
  people are not that simple, so hst isn't simple
  a lot of ww1 docs have never seen the light of day, all sorts of gaps in the hst record, constant change in perspective.


FR rev 1789
  is still every day in your face - we just choose to ignore it here in namerica. We don't have to!
    profoundly ignorant
  when we talk about rights for people, we are in effect echoing the sentiments of the FR rev, most places in the world are still working out the consequences; words we use every day - freedom, egalitarian, rights, where do they come from?
  'these great ideas' infuse every aspect
  for our course the most important idea, the best ism here,
    NATIONALISM
      we all think we understand.
      put together it's prolly most misleading word, esp. to canadians, it's nice and passive
      every where else it is a violent proposition
      once you start defining yourself by any means or measures you automatically exclude other people
      "modern engine of history"
	almost always very powerful, difficult, cancerous idea

      nations are the most important identifiers in the world we live in
      a phenomena of 18th and 19th century, starting in rev.

      prior to this no one really dealt with the concept

      15, 16, 17th century
	live to the age of 30, it generally sucks, no concept beyond your immediate sustenance and surrounding
	"who rules this place?"
	  the landlord, maybe local aristocrat
	  have you been to this town '50km away?'
	
	only 20th century has tourism started, 90% would never go beyond 50km away
	what is identification?
	  I raise cattle, I'm gendered, I speak foo
	  a serf of the duke of orleans
	  concept of belonging to a nation state doesn't exist for most people, except the tiny minority educated, in gov't, etc.
	  
	provinces might fight together, sometimes
	
	Another great truism:
	  Revolutions occur on basic commonalities
	  basic human reactions to basic conditions
	   seek profound change, "I'm hungry"

	  revolutionARIES are intellectual and frequently evil
	    bulk are avg peasants who are pissed off
	    you don't see fat revolutionaries
	
	FR is devastated by endless wars and terrible systems of politics

	it is in the fr rev they proclaim basically most ideas of equality
    
    at first they only wanted incremental change, but it quickly gets out of control
      they first associate the king with everything that is bad
	successive waves where more people influence the course until it hits the massive in the streets (who are basically angry at everybody)

      the king himself louis xvi 'apres moi le deluge'
	once you get rid of the system, who knows what follows

    'la revolution mange ses enfants'
      revolutionaries often become the victims of the revolution itself
	read tale of two cities

      Fr aristocracy is either killed off or forced into exile
      decide to create an entire new system of religion
	'cult of the supreme being'
      destroyed the calendar
      implemented the tricolor flag of france, national anthem

    Suddenly a bunch of peasants start to identify as 'french'. unprecedented; 
      this concept starts to spread
      for the first time ever people start to identify as groups of people — people are always striving to belong to something bigger
	conscription - what a better way to get people to clump together?

    Now that they are weak, everyone else in Europe invades:
    Revolutionary Wars 1789-1793
      all aristocratic houses related
      doesn't hurt that marie antoinette was related to the leader of the austro hungarian empire
	Now they are not only killing each other, they are also being invaded by everybody

      funnily enough, the french win big — once attacked they begin to take the identity to heart.

    
    France begins to stabilize and hungry with ambition and revenge:
    Napoleonic Wars 1801-1815

      Napoleon Bonaparte
	born in corsiga
	one of the greatest figures in hst, a product of fr revol
	not terribly wealthy background
	  without the revolution he would never have made it big
	
	definitely a dictator
	also a revolutionary
	  distinguishes himself by killing rioting people

	ahead of the time, believed in universal education
	  relatively free press
	believed in new governance, new economic system

	-> fundamentally changes Europe and the nature of the revolution
	
	by 1801 he rose thru the military and supplanted the revolutionary leadership, eventually becomes supreme leader of france
	  crowns himself as emperor - revolution has ceased to exist
	    even more powerful than a kind or the pope

	  yet not simply a dictator; 
	    most fr people support him absolutely
	      stupid and apathetic
	      most people forget stuff quickly
	    believes in some of the ideals, mass participation 
	      -> you can't stop an idea whose time has come.
	
	France by this stage is stable and very powerful.

      The revolution quickly spreads to nearby areas, the french turn out to be a really good army
	soldiers start to spread the idea
	people love a winner
     
     Nationalism spread thru language, the lowest common denominator
     Language draws borders - once nationalism mrches thru the old mixed empires are done for.
      --> Linguistic nationalism is the exact antithesis of empire.

      Wherever Napoleon's armies go this concept stretches and infects
	Language is the first thing that draws people together

      As his armies march across the centre of Europe they cross the germanic states, a criss cross of districts and territories dvidied by religion. 
	But they speak basically the same language.

      1812, Napoleon sets off for Russia, uh, in June
	"Don't fuck with Russia"
	  physically speaking biggest country of the world
	  geography is certainly important
	  time honored Russian traditions:
	    suffer
	    strategically retreat
	
	it gets really wet in sept
	  whole carts of horses disappeared in mud fields
	  and then it freezes over

	5/6ths of his army disappear in Russia.
	Huge unmitigated disaster

	People now rise up against the French

    Over the course of the next five or six decades the FR Rev ideas will change central europe; almost overnight a massive empire assembles in Germany as people assemble.

    Not only just in Europe; in Japan opens up in 1868 based on American diplomacy and now begins to think in terms of empire and nation
    1867 in Canada; 1861-65 US becomes a unified country

    Basically every country in the 19th century undergoes a nationalist change — *everything* changes

    The problem then becomes everyone who aspires to nationhood but then don't achieve it.


    Most of the time most people identify peacfully; unfortunate a lot of the time the moment you start identifying you exclude a lot of other people, which takes on militant proportions and extreme nationalism. 
      gotta get rid of the other people

    
    Napoleon's system collapses, until he comes back, escapes from prison, rebuilds another army and in june 1815 he has one last great battle in Waterloo, Belgium
    

    How do we undo this spectre of ideas?
    The great powers of Europe come together (Austria, Ottoman, UK, Russians, Prussia) and dictate a peace to France in the Congress of Vienna, the first of its kind.
      How do we now create a world in the absence of Napoleon?

      --> The Concert of Europe/Congress of Vienna system (historical term)
	notion of running the show in a beautiful congress
	two determinations
	  1. Make sure nationalism is CRUSHED
	    exact opposite of empire
	    whether by force or coersion, make sure nationalist id don't exist (some take it literally and kill them)
	    every empire tries this, keep the balance of power.
	  2. Make sure another dictator like Napoleon never manages to come into power
	    That's how they were to act in 'concert'

	  --> implicitly, you create alliances so we can come together and make sure everybody knows their place
	  unfortunately, the world does not work that way



  Ottoman Empire
    stretches from the cusp of Europe, the balkans to north africa
    all sorts of ethnicities and cultures


revolutionary wars 1789-1793

just one section



1754-1856 crimean
us civil
1866 austro prussian war
1866-68 danish wars
1870-71 franco prussian war
alsace, lorraine

'pressures for war'
  exert tremendous negative influence on the balance of power (empires)
  tracing the collapse of the intl order as we know it post 1815
  concert of europe system couldn't predict the future
    the principles are very loose
    nationalism is antithetical to empire

  no one was stupid enough to say 'there will be no more wars'
  what they were trying to do was limit the conflicts so that none of the great powers fought them or fought them in tandem

  Powers:
  Acting in unison, intermarried for centuries. Not ideologically different.
  Sense of tragedy and heaviness at heart - going to war against family members, with like minded people. Lots in common

    britain - rules the waves, sun never sets
    france
    austrian empire/austro-hungarian
    russia
    ottoman empire
      most culturally distracted, but not another world
      tended to be seen as quite different, but they're not totally foreign
    the german states, soon to become germany

    All fundamentally in agreement that they don't want a big war where everyone lines up against each other.
    ww1 was no surprise - a war is very likely to happen, inevitable
    tragic in that everyone was aware of these pressures

  Def of empire/power in 19th century - colonies and navies.

Big war
  --> Crimea: 1854-1856
    Southernmost tip of Russia, always biggest country in the world
    A certain tragedy to being Russia, it is surrounded by cold, useless ocean	grossly limited in navy
    The black sea on the other hand is sadly totally surrounded by the ottoman empire, who control these two bottlenecks.

    This yields a natural desire to fuck up the ottomans; the straits are tiny and easy to defend

    How do the UK and FR respond?
      Well shit, I guess we should side with Ottoman, can't let the ruskis get too big.
      Balance of power?
	The other powers don't show up.
	They send 'limited' armies that don't fight very well (this part unintended)

    War ends as a tie - but the Russian empire ends up denied access to the straits. Balance of power is maintained. The ydon't want anyone to lose really badly.

    Only accomplishment (russians never forget)
      srsly offended, harbour uk and fr resentment.

  #####
  --> US civil war 1861-1865
    Wasn't rly over slavery but the concept of states' rights.
    How an indiv state in the union views itself relative to the fed gov't
    War b/w Union (N) and the Confederacy (S).
      
    What does it have to do with intl order?
      UK very nearly found itself drawn to the war, to intervene on the side of the confederacy over cotton production
      Massively important for their textile industry, fuel for the industrial revolution, trade.
      Where is cotton also grown in Egypt and India, the other major cotton producers. Control of cotton represents an econ monopoly and essential for empire.

    At the eocivil war it becomes a true country. US has massive resources, once it spans the continent.

    American potential begins here.
    Surrounded by a giant moat and lacking natural enemies.

    Begins to change balance of power.

  #####
  --> 1866 Austro-Prussian War, 1866-68 Danish war
    Problem's abrewin'

    Nationalism running its course, the Danes and the Germans start to itch for independence.

    In Prussia, you start to have a real desire for a German confederation, nationhood. Prussian initiate the German states start to drawn upon themselves.

    Austria is all like fuuuuck thaaaat, but they fail.
      Other nationalities start to do the same. 
      Hungarians agitate, Austrians make a deal:
	We'll call ourselves the Austro-Hungarian, stick around and we'll give you an army and all that, dual monarchy

    Austrian Empire is desperate to maintain itself.

    How do the other powers respond to this?
      Other powers might supply some of the sides, but they do not get involved.

      Ethno linguistic map of the balkans, Hungarian has nothing to do with all the other langs in the region.
      Everyone else are Slavs. Fuck ton of minor ethnicities, but related to Russia; local crisis between these peeps, the Russians see them as cousins and are interested in bringing them into their empire. 
      Serbs are all like, Russia our buddies!

      Austria left to also fight all these Slavs. They are kind of fucked.

    --> In the 19th century we refer to the ottoman empire and the austro-hungarian empire as 'the sick men of europe'.
      Dying from within from the cancer of nationalism. Most acute in these countries. They collide in the same place (S. Europe)


  ####
  --> Franco-Prussian 1870-1871
    The one that challenges the intl order the most
    Leads to creation of Germany

    In terms of a people, DE is a very old place. Most philosophers, classical musicians, culture is old.

    German states divided by religion, lang dialects. Nationalist desire swells up, driven by intellectuals and leaders.

    1850s-1870s Prussia starts to get other peeps to join in to the idea of German unification. 
    Some remain with the Austrians but the momentum becomes very great.

    Post 1866 Prussia feels like it can use force other peeps to join.

    French do not like this.
      Balance of power gets fucked up.
      Mishmash of small states > giant german power
      Nobody exactly thrilled by this.

    Alsace and Lorraine
      The peeps in there are both FR and DE speakers. 
      Prussians want them in the confed, FR says le no

      No one else gets involved, disrupt balance of power.
      Fr seemed to poised to crush them

    Surprisingly, they totally fuck up the French brutally.
      Unification becomes a fait acompli.

    German army marches all the way to Versailles and proclaim unification.
    Immediately become massive power, becomes #1 industrial power.
      This rubs the Fr the wrong way.

    Balance of power totally fucked up.


Germany as a great power
  Would like to have a massive navy, colonies, immediately tweaks the British in the wrong way
    No colonies left aside from chunks of Africa.
    By late 19th century, race for Africa the last unspoiled part of the world.
    1885-1914 completely changes face of Africa

    Germans get Tanzania, kind of shitty. The German Cameroons, SouthWest Africa/Namibia - all desert. Brits have Egypt, and then the Suez canal. South Africa, which is fabolously rich, Nigeria and the Gold Coast (Ghana).
      Germans are so desperate they take anything free. One of the Hawaian islands. Little city states in China.

  What does this leave? You can take things by force.

  If you're France and Russia, you're scared. Giant power who does not like you. They ally each other as a safeguard - but this comes at a price.


  The British on the other hand... eh they are related. They don't *hate* each other. They definitely don't like the French nor the Russians. Their royal families are related. Natural allies.


Once more: overwhelming tragedy is that ww1 is a war that never should've happened. About 50% of the Germans on one side spoke great English. 

Unifcation of Germany: problematic. 
But nothing compared to the crisis in the Balkans.
  For 40 years prior ot ww1 everyone coulda told you that a war was coming.
  The Powder Keg of Europe

  --> 1878
    Serbia, one of the most militant of the Slavic nations, wanted nationhood. Start to demand more and more of the Aus-Hun empire; they can't submit or else they will cease to exist. Give into Serbia and everyone else will want in.
    They start to give certain powers like taxation and its own police force. The real trouble becomes when the Serbs start talking about the adjacent territories filled with Serb nationalists. Very nearly leads to war.

    Aus-Hun is prepared to fuck up the Serbs and make them an example.
      But! The Russians might have a problem with this and the Germans will find ways to make their influence felt.

    Good news: No war. Bad news: Gets postponed to 1914.
    The Russians back down, withdraw - the Tsar is forced to back down by the Germans who hint that they will flex a muscle, 'Never again, by god. never again' - Never again back down.  

    By 1878 all the ingredients for war are present.

###
Int'l pressures for war:
  1899-1901 Boer War
    Brits finds itself fighting a guerrila insurgency against dutch and german farmers aiming to create an independent homeland
    Brits squash them; takes them two years.

    Their empire goes to war; Canadians went to fight. 
    Germans secretely help the Boers.

  1898-1900 Spanish American War
    Spain has descended into chaos, and the US ostensibly goes to war over Cuba to 'protect it'. Within a few weeks US inherits a global empire, getting Dom Rep, Puerto Rico, the Phillipines. 

    Balance of power becomes totally different, new world order.

  1900 Boxer Rebellion
    Lots of Chinese nationalists (read: anti western) upset over the steep decay of its old empire. Get crushed.

    'Fists of Harmonious Righteousness' -> Boxers

    China became a buffet for westerners to pick over.

  Balance becomes too fragmented for the Concert to keep working.
  Change is seldom peaceable, it's terrifying. Most nations completely freak out at the pace of change.

  Not only do they have to deal with this, they now have to face ideology and epidemics.
